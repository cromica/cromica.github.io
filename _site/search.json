There are lots of ways to share information and knowledge but blog allows to share information in detail and also provide thorough explanations. Besides this I intend to use it as a personal knowledge base. Quite often I realize that I've done something similar in the past but I can't remember or find the information. So finally here it is. The Journey There are quite a few things to think about when deciding to have a blog, like: What will I write about? What blogging platform should I use? Since I’m a developer should I build something of my own? Where I will host it? What’s the design of the blog ? There some other smaller things but those where the main questions for me. For the first one I’ve answered in the first paragraph but let’s see a bit about the other questions. First of all I’m not a big Wordpress fan although I’ve used it in the past. This is not because it’s bad rather it’s a mater of taste. Next I had a look at Ghost which is really interesting and nice. There are some other good blogging platforms like Blogger or Tumblr and I have to admit that it’s hard to decide between them but I wanted to have more control so just a blogging platform was a no go for me. Building something of my own was interesting enough but I quickly realize that I don’t have enough time to do it so I abandoned the idea. Looking for other option I read David Ebbo was moving his site to Github pages and decided to have a look. I really liked the way Github pages is working and I will tell more about this on future posts. So at this point my blog is hosted by Github pages and this is just the first version of it. I will add some other features in the next weeks. "},{"title":"Why I choose Github pages","url":"/blog/2014/02/24/why-i-choose-github-pages.html","date":"2014-02-24 23:52:21 +0200","categories":["blog"],"body":"Github pages is something I've recently heard of and I really like it from the begging although I didn't exactly knew how is working. The main idea is that you will use a github repository to serve your site or blog. Main benefits For me these are the main benefits in using github pages: I have complete control of my site not being constrained in any way by a blogging platform. No database is involved since github pages will serve only static html. Pages will be produced using Jekyll (more on this in future post). It’s completely free so I don’t need to bother looking for hosting options. And it has very good performance . It uses markdown for create and edit posts. Beside that github offers in-browser support for markdown which means that I can create or edit posts directly from browser. Since github pages uses github repositories it means that anyone can contribute to the website by sending a pull request . So please fell free to send any changes or if you see any spelling errors you can directly correct them, all you need to do is go to the repository and submit a pull request . If anyone has any suggestions on various features I can add or any changes please let me know by creating an issue or drop me a line . I really like github pages because it’s very simple to use and it’s emphasizes collaboration so anyone can become a contributor to the blog.

In the previous posts I've talked about the reasons to start a blog , why I choose github pages to host it and now I will talk about Jekyll, the engine behind my blog. What is Jekyll ? Jekyll is a parsing engine which generates static html pages from dynamic components like template or markdown files. It uses a simple inline syntax which at build time is evaluated and replaced resulting a static page. Here is a short and very simple example: <meta http-equiv= \"Content-type\" content= \"text/html; charset=utf-8\" /> <title> {{ page.title }} </title> In the above example the value for the title tag will be set with the value of the title property of the page object. Jekyll has a simple and limited syntax so it’s quit easy to learn it, but it has great flexibility with lots of options on how to build the site. Also you can have partial files which Jekyll will combine at build time. Jekyll has a special folder structure which is used in order to generate the static website: _includes folder is used to define partial files which can then be added to various pages. Some possible partial files might be the footer or header which for sure will be nice to define in one place and use on all pages. _layout folder is pretty self explanatory and is the location where you will define the layouts of your pages. _posts folder is the location from where dynamic content/posts will be saved. Jekyll uses a markup language like Markdown for this kind of files. _drafts folder is where the working in progress stuff will be held since this location will not be evaluated at build unless --draft is specified. _site folder is the location from where Jekyll will serve the static pages. During the build process Jekyll will combine partial files and evaluate the syntax producing a static html file which will be saved in this folder. Jekyll and Github pages Jekyll can be installed locally and since it has a small static webserver embedded it can be used in lots of ways to serve the website. Using jekyll serve you can build and browse the site. Beside this option you can use the site developed with Jekyll directly with Github pages since behind the scenes it uses Jekyll. So all you have to do is push your site developed with jekyll to a repository and Github will do the trick almost instant. Please be aware that this is not true for all Github repositories, it’s only valid for Github pages repositories which must be created according to this steps . My intention with this article was to give a high overview of what Jekyll means and some basic principles. If you are looking for more details please have a look here and here . If you have any questions please don’t hesitate and leave a comment.

More on this you can read on my blog post .Every time I write a new article or make a change I would like to preview it before publishing it to live website.When this get published to my website repository, Github builds it almost instantly so I'm able to see my change really fast, but this is still done on the public website. This can work pretty well but I prefer to see my changes locally and only if I'm ok to publish them on my repository . So in order to do that I need to install jekyll on my local machine and use `jekyll serve` to build and serve the website. Install Jekyll on a Windows machine Jekyll is build with Ruby and uses some Python libraries so we need to install them in order to run Jekyll. Since most the work I do is around Microsoft .Net platform I need to use Windows operating system . My source of inspiration was this article by David Ebbo. In his artcile he points to this article which explains all the steps in detail. The information is perfectly valid at this moment so you can follow that too but I would like to show you a simple way using Chocolatey . The steps are pretty much the same with the article, the only difference is in the way you install the applications. What is Chocolatey ? Chocolatey is a global PowerShell execution engine using the NuGet packaging infrastructure. Think of it as the ultimate automation tool for Windows. It is very simple to install Chocolatey you just have to run this script on your command prompt: @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command \"iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\" && SET PATH = % PATH %; % systemdrive %\\ chocolatey \\ bin If this doesn’t work for you there are other ways to install chocolatey here . Now that we have chocolatey installed we can open a command prompt and using cinst we can install what we need. Install Ruby Run the following command on the command prompt: >cinst ruby To check if it was installed with success close then open a new command prompt and run: > ruby –version Install Ruby Devkit Here are the steps required to install and configure Devkit: cinst ruby2.devkit Initialize and configure by updating config.yml file from the devkit folder. In the command prompt type the following: >cd “C:\\DevKit2” ruby dk.rb init notepad config.yml This will open notepad where you need to add - C:\\tools\\ruby200 at the end of the file. This path represents the location where ruby was installed and it might be different than the one I’ve specified. After this step you need to go back to the command prompt and install gem : >ruby dk.rb review ruby dk.rb install At this point you should have gem installed. You can check it this way: >gem –version If it’s not working try to close and then open a new command prompt. Install Jekyll Run the following command on the command prompt: >gem install jekyll What is Pygments ? Pygments is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to prettify source code. Pygments is written in python so we need to install Python Install Python Run the following command on the command prompt: > cinst python2 Run the following command in a new command prompt to verify installation: >python –version Install ‘Easy Install’ Easy Install is a mechanism similar with ruby gems or chocolatey for python packages. In order to install it follow the steps: 1.Download ez_setup.py 2.Run the following command from the location where you saved ez_setup.py >python ez_setup.py 3.Set the ‘Python Scripts’ directory (e.g. C:\\tools\\python2\\Scripts ) to PATH 4.Verify that easy_install is installed properly: > easy_install –help Install Pygments Now that we have python and easy install all we just need to run the following commnad to install pygments: >easy_install pygments Start Jekyll You can now create a new Jekyll blog which can be browsed on localhost:4000 : >jekyll new myblog cd myblog jekyll serve I found it much easier to install all this using Chocolatey. I’m keen to get your feedback on this.

The Journey Well I was thinking to start a blog for sometime because of the reasons I’ve pointed in my first article Why a blog ? . This is a technical blog since I will write most of the time about software development and various technologies in an attempt to share my knowledge and experience but also because I want to us it as a brain dump. From time to time I might write about some other things but probably still around technology. Finally this year I started looking for various options to host a blog and I ended up using Github pages . Why I made this option I’ve detailed in my blog post Why I choose Github pages . Github pages is powered by a very nice and interesting framework called Jekyll for which I wrote an introduction in my article The engine behing my blog . Since my work is most of the time in Microsoft world I had to install Jekyll on Windows which is not necessarily straight forward so I described an easier alternative using chocolatey in my article Install Jekyll using chocolatey . I’m really glad that finally I manage to start this blog but I guess the real challenge comes now when I will need to actually use it and keep it alive. I hope you will find my journey useful to decide start a blog or if you are already decided to assist in your steps to get the blog started.

Endava is a company that constantly tries to improve based on previous experiences and feedback so last week I had brief exit interview which is meant to provide feedback to the company. I have to admit that I really enjoyed this last discussion where I had one last opportunity to directly share my ideas with Endava. My journey with Endava was about 7 years and a half. All this years had a great impact on my career and who am I today. When I joined the company I was a naive developer who was just interested in writing some code but slowly that changed because the company was constantly taking care of my growth and career path. I really think that Endava provides a great working environment where you can learn, grow and expand your skills regardless of the fact that you are just starting your career or you have several years of experience. Certainly I will miss my colleagues from Endava with which I shared so many great experiences, but I’m still going to be around so don’t be a stranger suddenly. I want to thank you all for your great support and help during all this years. But because I’m leaving it doesn’t mean that we can’t stay in touch. For sure I’m going to post more often on this blog so you can leave a comment or find me on Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook, Gmail. Thanks Endava for all this great years.

Almost everyone asked me what does that mean and what will I do so I decided that I better explain here in detail. If you are looking for a general definition of the position you can find one on wikipedia but it won't help you too much. In order to understand it better you really need to understand the context. Who is SDL? First off all let me tell you a few words about SDL and what is the company doing. It started as language translation service company and quickly become also a company providing software for language translation. For many years this was the only domain where SDL activated but new interesting opportunities arise and the company made new acquisitions on domains like e-commerce, social media monitoring, web content management, analytics and so on. All this new products allowed SDL to re-position itself recently as a global customer experience management company. If you are looking for more details please have a look here for the history of the company and here for the new vision and mission. What I’m going to do at SDL? As I previously said SDL is offering now global customer experience management and as you might already think when you say global you immediately think of multiple languages, which means translation. I’m going to be closely involved in SDL Trados Studio and Language Cloud and probably some other products depending on the needs. Most of my work will be around creating and growing the development community for this products, but I will also offer support and consultancy to clients and help the sale process when is necessary. Growing the development community can mean many things but here are some of they key things I will do: Explain better the current Studio API’s and in what product areas it can be used. Improve and simplify the current API based on community and clients feedback. Contribute to the new Language Cloud SDK. Simplify how we can use develop against the API’s. The most important bit will be to have them open to all possible developers. Speak at developer conferences and discuss about the API’s and SDK’s. If you have any suggestion or you want me at a conference just leave a comment. Contribute and help develop the new community platform which we will launch in the near future. Develop plugins based on customer needs. This will also act as examples for other developers. I think this is very interesting and I’m really keen to see how things will evolve since there are many other things that I would like to do as part of my new role. Also SDL has some interesting plans around the community so stay tuned.

Most known,at least by me, are ITCamp and Codecamp. ITCamp is held once a year in Cluj-Napoca and Codecamp is held twice a year in Iasi, although there are some smaller Codecamp events in Cluj those are not related. I'm really happy that this year I had the opportunity to participate at all 3 events, so a big big thanks to the organizers for having me. Codecamp I’ve never been to Iasi until this year and I can’t say that I’ve seen too much of it since both times I’ve been there I was caught up with Codecamp event. Although I’ve haven’t seen much of the city I’ve met really nice people which are really passionate about software industry. Each event had more than 1400 participants which I believe it’s a really big achievement. The fact that there is no fee to participate at the conference opened the door even to students which had a great opportunity to get in touch with the industry and basically their future. The event is also for seniors who can find lots interesting topics and a good place to network. For me Codecamp was a nice experience and I can’t wait for the next edition which will probably happen in spring 2015. Kudos to Florin Cardasim , Gabriel Enea and Dan Nicola who believed in their ideas and made this possible. My sessions I had two session which I presented this year at Codecamp . The first one which I’ve done in may is Information Exchange using Hybrid Azure Integration . In this session I’m talking about ways we can integrate on-premise LOB applications with azure cloud solutions based on messaging pattern. The second session which I had last weekend is Click’n’Deploy . This one was done together with Radu Pascal and it was my first duet session. In this talk we present our approach on enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment using TFS Build , Gulp and Octopus Deploy . During the session we showed how we’ve implemented it in a real life example. If want to see more pictures have a look here .

The best tool handle this type of operations in .NET, at least in my opinion, is Json.NET . It made perfect sense to use it but until now I didn't use any external dependencies in an SDL Studio plugin so I started to look into what options we have to deploy our plugins together with 3rd party assemblies. SDL Studio plugins This is not a detailed look at what SDL Studio plugins are but I want to give a bit of context on how they are working. First of all each plugin has to be packed in a package with extension .sldplugin (this a zip file in essence). If you use the SDL Studio templates from Visual Studio this done for you automatically. Once you have the package you need to deploy it in one of the three location where SDL Studio is expecting plugins: $(CurrentUser)\\AppData\\Local\\SDL\\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\\Plugins\\Packages\\ $(CurrentUser)\\AppData\\Roaming\\SDL\\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\\Plugins\\Packages\\ $(ProgramData)\\SDL\\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\\Plugins\\Packages\\ There is no difference between this locations so you can choose whatever you prefer. Once the package is in one of this locations when SDL Studio starts it will unpack the package, drop the content into a dedicated location and load the plugin assembly. This depends on where you deployed your package and can be one of this locations: $(CurrentUser)\\AppData\\Local\\SDL\\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\\Plugins\\Unpacked\\ $(CurrentUser)\\AppData\\Roaming\\SDL\\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\\Plugins\\Unpacked\\ $(ProgramData)\\SDL\\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\\Plugins\\Unpacked\\ Deploy 3rd party assemblies Now that we have a brief understanding on how SDL Studio handles plugins let’s see what options we have to deploy 3rd party plugins: Include the assemblies in the plugin package Create an installer which will copy the 3rd party assemblies into SDL Studio folder under $(ProgramFiles) Although the second option can work I don’t like it because it requires more work, administrative rights to deploy the assemblies and might intefere with Studio installation. This was also suggest by David Fritch in this thread as a possible way to do it. I consider the first option the right way to do it since it’s very simple and clean. All you have to do is change the pluginpackage.manifest.xml which has to be part of the solution in order to generate the .sdlplugin file. By default this xml file contains some tags to specify the plugin name, version, description, author and required SDL Studio product. You will need to add an <Include> tag which in my case, for Json.NET , looked something like this: <Include> <File> Newtonsoft.Json.dll </File> </Include> You can have a look at my entire xml file here .

There are 2 types of plugins that can be developed, one which behaves like a Studio add-in and another one which behaves as a standalone application. Both plugin types require to run inside Studio installation folder. This is because the public Studio SDK is using other assemblies that are located in Studio folder. While this is perfectly fine for add-in type plugins for standalone plugins this adds limitation on where and how you can deploy your application. Why not GAC ? Many developers have asked us to register Studio assemblies in GAC in order to solve the issue on where and how you can deploy your standalone Studio plugins. Having Studio assemblies registered in GAC means that those assembly can be shared across the entire system. Although registering assemblies in GAC might had seem to be a good solution there are many implications when doing it. The main reason why Studio is not using GAC is because of the following scenario: GAC supports multiple version of an assembly. This means that when an assembly is updated to a newer version both versions will be saved. You might say that the old version should be removed, but this is not always possible since for example there are customers that have multiple version of Studio that are used on the same machine. Keeping multiple version of the same assembly will lead to unexpected behavior and errors from the application. You can read more about why to avoid GAC here . Got it … no GAC, but we want solutions! To solve this problem I’ve developed a small library called Studio AssemblyResolver . Basically every time an dll is not found in the current application location the library will look after the dll in the Studio folder. The library comes with 2 mechanism for looking after Studio folder but you can add your own resolve mechanism. If you are interested about more details please have a look here . The library is also published in the Nuget package repository which allows to be easily added to your project. How to use Studio AssemblyResolver There are 2 simple steps to get your Studio assemblies resolved: Add a reference to the Studio.AssemblyResolver library from Visual Studio using NuGet Add the following line of code in you application entry point AssemblyResolver . Resolve (); I’ve already included the Studio AssemblyResolver library in Reindex Translation Memories plugin. You can have a look here if you are interested to see how I’ve included the library.

This can be done using Studio File Type Framework which is part of the Studio SDK. The documentation is providing an overview of the entire framework and also includes high level overview of what I'm going to discuss in this article. Visitor Pattern Before jumping into the problem I recommend you to get familiarized with the visitor pattern since this is used as part of the Studio File Type Framework and you will need apply it in order to get the tags. To get familiarized you can read the theory on wikipedia or if you want a practical example you can have a look here . In Studio File Type Framework visitor pattern is made available via IMarkupDataVisitor interface. Paragraphs, Segments and more When a document is opened for translation Studio brakes it into segments. This is done by the segmentation engine using the segmentation rules defined in Studio. A segment can be a paragraph or a sentence length but what is important to understand is that for Studio a segment represents a piece of localizable content for which existing translations can possibly be used. Besides localizable content there are other elements, like formatting, that Studio needs to take into considerations. Now that we have a better understanding of how Studio is handling the content let me highlight how this is reflected in the File Type Framework: IParagraph represents the entire content that is displayed on one Studio editor row. This can contain multiple elements like tags or segments. IParagraphUnit a unit of source language content and the localized target language content. Source and Target can be accessed using the corresponding properties which will return an IParagraph object instance with the information described above. One thing to keep in mind is that there are two type of paragraph units: Structure paragraph units will contain only structure tags that are not localizable. In this case the Target will be null. Localizable paragraph units will contain localizable content. ISegment represents a piece of localizable content. ISegmentPair segments exists in source and target language versions which are bot accessible using ISegmentPair . Segments and Paragraphs are considered containers of other elements like text, comments, revisions and so on. All containers share common behavior and that’s why in the File Type Framework both are abstracted using IAbstractMarkupDataContainer . An IAbstractMarkupDataContainer contains multiple IAbstractMarkupData elements. This means that text, comments and other similar elements are represented in the framework using IAbstractMarkupData interface. One very important aspect of this structure is the fact that a segment can be considered as an element of the paragraph but also as a container for other elements which means that it can be manipulated as an IAbstractMarkupDataContainer or as an IAbstractMarkupData . Here’s a diagram which describes the structure: Access segment tags All paragraph elements are like a tree structure that must be traversed using visitor pattern. For each paragraph unit we can look at the Source property which is an IParagraph . Thinking at the abstraction I was talking earlier an IParagraph is in essence an IAbstractMarkupDataContainer which in turn is an enumeration of IAbstractMarkupData . Here’s a sample code on how you can iterate paragraph unit elements: IEnumerable < IAbstractMarkupData > container = paragraphUnit . Source ; foreach ( var contentItem in container ) { //structure tag is not supported by IMarkupDataVisitor and you should ignore it IStructureTag stag = contentItem as IStructureTag ; if ( stag == null ) continue ; contentItem . AcceptVisitor ( new MarkupDataVisitor ()); } There is one new thing in the above sample which I didn’t discuss about.This is MarkupDataVisitor which is an implementation of the interface IMarkupDataVisitor I was mentioning in the visitor pattern section. Here’s how the interface looks like: /// <summary> /// Interface for the visitor in the visitor pattern implementation for translatable source / target /// content items in a localizable paragraph unit. /// </summary> public interface IMarkupDataVisitor { /// <summary> /// Called by tag pair instances. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"tagPair\"></param> void VisitTagPair ( ITagPair tagPair ); /// <summary> /// Called by placeholder tag instances. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"tag\"></param> void VisitPlaceholderTag ( IPlaceholderTag tag ); /// <summary> /// Called by text instances. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"text\"></param> void VisitText ( IText text ); /// <summary> /// Called by segment instances. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"segment\"></param> void VisitSegment ( ISegment segment ); /// <summary> /// Called by location marker instances. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"location\"></param> void VisitLocationMarker ( ILocationMarker location ); /// <summary> /// Called by comment marker instances. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"commentMarker\"></param> void VisitCommentMarker ( ICommentMarker commentMarker ); /// <summary> /// Called by other marker instances. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"marker\"></param> void VisitOtherMarker ( IOtherMarker marker ); /// <summary> /// Called by locked content instances. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"lockedContent\"></param> void VisitLockedContent ( ILockedContent lockedContent ); /// <summary> /// Called by revision marker instances. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"revisionMarker\"></param> void VisitRevisionMarker ( IRevisionMarker revisionMarker ); } As you can see you are now able manipulate each element type. For example if you need formatting information you can get it from the ITagPair interface. Don’t forget that segments are containers as well so on VisitSegement method you need to traverse his structure in the same way as for the paragraph unit.

You now have a single centralized place where you go and search for what you need, click a button and in a matter of minutes you have the app working on your device. In a similar way you can extend SDL Studio by going on OpenExchange store and download a plugin you would like or need. Now this works just fine for most of the Studio plugins or apps but there are situations when you need to develop something that is specific for your company and doesn't make sense to be public to everyone since it's probably irrelevant for them and it might also contain confidential information. It would be nice if you would be able to create your private store inside OpenExchange where you can have you apps centralized and search-able just by you but such a feature is not available at the moment. This article and video is about an alternate solution for this type of scenarios. The solution The solution is very simple and is based on the idea to automate as much as possible the process of releasing you plugin. The exact same thing is promoted by Continuous Delivery practice and together with the evolution of this a couple of release management tools like Octopus Deploy or GO appeared in order to ease the adoption of such a practice. In our case since Studio plugins are developed using Microsoft .Net and it makes perfect sense to use Octopus Deploy since is dedicated for .Net solutions. Of course you can try and use GO or any other release management tool you prefer. If it’s not clear by now the solution I’m talking about is to automate your Studio plugin release management using Octopus Deploy . Octopus Deploy I’m not going to cover in detail Octopus Deploy since it comes with a very good documentation, rather I’m going to present a higher level overview of how is going to work with Studio plugins. Octopus comes with a central server component which is called Octopus Deploy Server that you need to install somewhere where all your users machines will be able to access it. It can be an internal private server, a public server or somewhere in a cloud platform, there is no limitation as long as it’s accessible. Octopus Deploy Server comes with web user interface which you can use once you have the server installed. Besides the server component Octopus comes with a client component called Tentacle Deploy agent . This has to be installed on each user machine and it will be used to deploy your software, in our case the Studio plugins. This is a one time operation and once it’s done you will only use the web user interface that comes with the server. There is a third component called OctoPack that is used to push the software/Studio plugin from you development or build machine to Octopus Deploy Server . Click’n’Deploy Studio plugins There are quit a few moving parts when you first setup Octopus Deploy and some of the steps might not that obvious so instead off writing them in this article I decided that it would be better if just create a video to show you exactly how you configure Octopus to release Studio plugins to the user machine.

The toolkit was written to facilitate scripting of the Project Automation API which comes with SDL Studio. Until now this was kept on the SDL internal TFS and you where only able to get it by going to the community forum. At this point you might ask yourself what's going to change from now on since the toolkit was freely distributed until now? Github The project is now hosted on github in this location . The internal TFS will no longer be used so this means that every change that will be made to the toolkit will be made on this repository including changes done by Sdl developers. Also this allows any interested developer to contribute to the toolkit. Public releases are also hosted on github and you can be find them here . You are now able to download the entire toolkit or just one of the modules. Open source Open source it’s not at all equal to free, it’s much more than that. Yes you don’t have to pay any money for this toolkit but from now on is not only Sdl’s responsibility to maintain this toolkit, it’s also the responsibility of each toolkit user or developer. To be a bit more specific if you find bug or want a new feature you can log it here but don’t necessarily expect someone from Sdl to resolve the issue, it might be anyone from the community or even you. Another important aspect that comes with open source is that every change you made to this toolkit has to be made open source. It’s not mandatory to be made in the same repository but it has to be open source. I would encourage everyone to contribute to this repository and make the resolved issues available to everyone. Conclusion Contribute to Sdl Studio PowerShell toolkit from here or download the latest release from here . Please leave a comment if you have any questions or feedback.

This can be done during project creation and it can be useful in situations where you have multiple small files and you might want to translate them in one go without switching between documents. If you don't already know SDL Studio is very extensible via the API's that are made available but sometimes simple things are not so simple to do by code because of software design decision or technical limitations. Merging files using SDL Studio Project Automation API can be done but is not that straight forward as you might expect and this is why I decided to write this article to show how this is done. Create Merged Project File Looking at the documentation you can easily find CreateMergedProjectFile method which allows you to specify the files you want to be merged and the name of the bilingual file which must have “.sdlxliff” extension. At this point this seems to be very simple but when you run this method you realize that is not actually doing much, there is no visible result on the project and the status is Not Merged . What am I missing? At this point you only get an MergedProjectFile object which is just a representation of the merging structure. In order to actually create the bilingual merged file we need to use Studio File Type Framework to generate the sdlxliff file. Once we have that we can use CopyToTargetLanguages to copy the merged files to all target languages we need. To make this even more clear and concrete I’m going to share a sample code that is doing all the steps I’ve described until now. Conclusion It’s not that complicated to merge files using the SDL Studio API but is not obvious and intuitive. I hope this article will clarify this situation.

I was busy at that moment so I couldn't write my recommendations but he suggested that I should write an article on my blog. I thought that it's a great idea so here it is my list of recommendations. Although most of the times a I code in C# most of the books are technology agnostic which means every developer can read them. For blooming developers This are some of the books I recommend for developers which are just starting their career. It’s not that they shouldn’t read more advanced books but those might be a bit too difficult for the moment. Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin The book is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. - Amazon The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers by Robert C. Martin In The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act. - Amazon C# in Depth, 3rd Edition by Jon Skeet C# in Depth is a book for those who are passionate about C#. It aims to be a bridge between the existing introductory books and the language specification: something readable but detailed, exploring every aspect of the language from version 2 onwards. In the interests of brevity, it doesn’t spend much time on C# 1 - readers are already expected to know the first version at least reasonably. Every new feature from C# 2 onwards is covered, however, as shown in the table of contents below. - C# in Depth For experienced developers Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, 2nd Edition by Kent Beck Whether you have a small team that is already closely aligned with your customers or a large team in a gigantic or multinational organization, you will find in these pages a wealth of ideas to challenge, inspire, and encourage you and your team members to substantially improve your software development. - Amazon Implementation Patterns by Kent Beck Implementation Patterns will help programmers at all experience levels, especially those who have benefited from software patterns or agile methods. It will also be an indispensable resource for development teams seeking to work together more efficiently and build more maintainable software. No other programming book will touch your day-to-day work more often. - Amazon Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software by Eric Evans This book provides a broad framework for making design decisions and a technical vocabulary for discussing domain design. It is a synthesis of widely accepted best practices along with the author’s own insights and experiences. Projects facing complex domains can use this framework to approach domain-driven design systematically. - DDDCommunity Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition by Steve McConnell Capturing the body of knowledge available from research, academia, and everyday commercial practice, McConnell synthesizes the most effective techniques and must-know principles into clear, pragmatic guidance. No matter what your experience level, development environment, or project size, this book will inform and stimulate your thinking—and help you build the highest quality code. - Amazon Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler , Kent Beck , John Brant , William Opdyke , Don Roberts Refactoring is about improving the design of existing code. It is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, yet improves its internal structure. With refactoring you can even take a bad design and rework it into a good one. This book offers a thorough discussion of the principles of refactoring, including where to spot opportunities for refactoring, and how to set up the required tests. There is also a catalog of more than 40 proven refactorings with details as to when and why to use the refactoring, step by step instructions for implementing it, and an example illustrating how it works The book is written using Java as its principle language, but the ideas are applicable to any OO language. - Amazon Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation by Jez Humble , David Farley Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours— sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. - Amazon Dependency Injection in .NET by Mark Seemann Dependency Injection in .NET introduces DI and provides a practical guide for applying it in .NET applications. The book presents the core patterns in plain C#, so you’ll fully understand how DI works. Then you’ll learn to integrate DI with standard Microsoft technologies like ASP.NET MVC, and to use DI frameworks like StructureMap, Castle Windsor, and Unity. By the end of the book, you’ll be comfortable applying this powerful technique in your everyday .NET development. - Amazon The Art of Unit Testing: with examples in C# by Roy Osherove The Art of Unit Testing, Second Edition guides you step by step from writing your first simple unit tests to building complete test sets that are maintainable, readable, and trustworthy. You’ll move quickly to more complicated subjects like mocks and stubs, while learning to use isolation (mocking) frameworks like Moq, FakeItEasy, and Typemock Isolator. You’ll explore test patterns and organization, refactor code applications, and learn how to test “untestable” code. Along the way, you’ll learn about integration testing and techniques for testing with databases. The examples in the book use C#, but will benefit anyone using a statically typed language such as Java or C++. - Amazon For those about to rock Software is about solving people problems and to do that you need more than just coding skills. If you want to rock you need to deliver the software as people expect it. On top of the technical books I recommend a few books that can help you rock. User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development by Mike Cohn The best way to build software that meets users’ needs is to begin with “user stories”: simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality that will be valuable to real users. In User Stories Applied, Mike Cohn provides you with a front-to-back blueprint for writing these user stories and weaving them into your development lifecycle. - Amazon Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects by Gojko Adzic This handbook is a practical guide to impact mapping, a simple yet incredibly effective method for collaborative strategic planning that helps organisations make an impact with software. Impact mapping helps to create better plans and roadmaps that ensure alignment of business and delivery, and are easily adaptable to change. Impact mapping fits nicely into several current trends in software product management and release planning, including goal-oriented requirements engineering, frequent iterative delivery, agile and lean software methods, lean startup product development cycles, and design thinking. - Amazon Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories by Gojko Adzic , David Evans This is a book for anyone working in an iterative delivery environment, doing planning with user stories. The ideas in this book are useful both to people relatively new to user stories and those who have been working with them for years. People who work in software delivery, regardless of their role, will find plenty of tips for engaging stakeholders better and structuring iterative plans more effectively. Business stakeholders working with software teams will discover how to provide better information to their delivery groups, how to set better priorities and how to outrun the competition by achieving more with less software. - Leanpub Final words The above recommendations are based on the books I’ve read and had a big influence on me. There many other great books which I didn’t heard off or I didn’t manage to read yet so please leave a comment with your recommendations.

You can read more about this here: Steps to upgrade your plugin for Studio 2015 . Now with all Studio versions out there some may ask how can I control my plugin versions and how can I make sure my plugin will be used only by the appropriate version of SDL Studio. Plugin manifest Every plugin must contain a manifest file that defines a few general information about your plugin. The file is called pluginpackage.manifest.xml and if you open any *.sdlplugin file with and archiving tool, like 7zip , you should be able to see it and open it. Also when you create a new plugin solution in Microsoft Visual Studio this file will be automatically created for you and it will be included in our plugin package (.sdlplugin file). In this file you can add your plugin name, description, author, version, required product and you can specify additional files to be included in the package . Plugin versioning As I highlighted before you can specify a plugin version by using the tag: > Version This is used by SDL Studio to remove previously deployed plugins. For example if you have on your machine a plugin with version 0.1.0.0 if you install a new version like 0.1.1.0 it will automatically remove the unpacked version of the plugin and unpack the newer version. If the version is the same or lower this will not happen hence you will have to do it yourself. Product versioning Besides plugin versioning you can also specify SDL Studio versions that are compatible with your plugin. This can be done using the tag: >RequiredProduct On this tag you can specify in the attribute minversion the lowest SDL Studio version that is compatible with your plugin. For example if you specify a minimum version of 10.0 this means that your plugin will be compatible with Studio 2011 or higher. If you want to limit your plugin just to a specific SDL Studio version you can also specify a maxversion attribute. So for example if in our case we add a maximum version of 10.9 this will not be compatible with Studio 2014 or higher and even if it’s copied into the Studio 2014 plugins folder it will be ignored. Universal plugin installer The universal plugin installer is also using this information to avoid deploying plugins that are not compatible with a specific Studio version. If you are not familiar with the universal plugin installer you can read more here: SDL plugin installer . Final words I recommend to review your manifest file and take advantage of the versioning capabilities. Even if there is no obvious reason at the moment it might prove handy in the future.

To be more exact there are 6 APIs you can use to build your application. This degree of complexity and extensibility translates in a huge amount of settings you can play with. The user interface does a great job presenting them in a meaningful way but that is not the same when you want to develop something in your custom applications and you need to read or update some of the settings. Project Settings Lets say you are in a situation where the API is not offering you direct access to the user setting you would like to change, what options you have in this situation? A great amount of settings are store in the project file which in essence it’s an xml file. This mean I could use the standard .NET libraries to parse the project xml file and change what I need. This is completely true and can be done but the problem is knowing the xml structure which for the project file can be pretty complex and hard to understand. To give you an example the project file for a very simple test project is over 1000 lines. Understanding those lines can take some time and patience. Before continuing I want to clarify one thing which is knowing that the SDL Studio project file is not only about user settings it’s much more than that, things that are used internal by Studio so we need to be very careful when we change anything in this file. My recommendation would be to use the settings classes exposed by SDL Studio Core API. Settings Bundle and Group User settings are stored in hierarchical structure as settings bundles. A bundle is bound to a feature from SDL Studio. For example I can have a settings bundle for project specific settings, another project bundle with settings for language direction, another one for language file and so on. Each bundle will have unique identifier as a GUID value and can have one or multiple child elements in form of settings group. A settings group represent a smaller piece from the bundle feature and can have, as child’s, one or multiple settings. As an example of settings group you can think at specific settings for a file type which is part of the project settings bundle. With this said the SDL Studio API has ISettingsBundle interface and a SettingsGroup class used to represent the hierarchical structure I explained above. The API doesn’t expose a concrete implementation of ISettingsBundle so you need to use SettingsUtils class to create an instance of settings bundle. Real use case To clarify the things a bit I want to show you a real use case where you can use the settings classes from the SDL Studio Core API. Let’s say that for a project we want to disable all the global verifiers. This value is kept in the project file and can be changed using .NET xml libraries or using the settings classes I explained in the previous paragraph. Here’s the code required to implement this feature: In this case I obtain the settings group id by instantiating all the global verifiers but you can request the setting group also by just providing the string.

If you want to see the entire list of changes included in this update have a look here . Now lets get down to business and talk about the integration api changes. Table of contents This is a pretty long post and you might not want to read through the entire article so if you want to read only a specific topic I prepared a jump-list with the topics I cover in this article: Segment translation on-demand Active file properties Access/update segment and paragraph unit properties CRUD operations on comments Change segment confirmation level AutoSuggest provider icon Segment Content ready Segment translation on-demand Segment translation is done by the translation providers that are configured and enabled at the project level. This can happen as a pre-translation step or when the current segment is changed by the user in the user interface. With this new feature added to the integration API a developer is able to request the translation of the current selected segment whenever this is needed. This can be done from the EditorController . To see this in action you can look at this sample: This sample code is take from the Controlled Machine Translation Providers plugin. Active file properties Until now developers were only able to get information about ActiveFile like statistics, language, project id and so on. There was no way to get information like creation date, change date, metada and so on. This is now possible using ActiveFileProperties property of the Document class. Also an event was added to notify when the active file properties are changed. Access/update segment and paragraph unit properties Update 23.09.2015 - This feature didn’t make it in Studio 2014 CU10 and it’s available only in Studio 2015 If you needed to make any work around segments the only available option was to use ProcessSegmentPairs method from the Document class. Now this can do the trick but it’s not straightforward to use and can be an overhead for simple scenarios, also this method was not providing any way to interact with paragraph units. We’ve now added a couple other options that provide more granularity and flexibility in how a developer is able to process segments. We also added capabilities to work directly with paragraph units. Here’s the list with the methods available: GetSegmentPairsFromParagraph - Based on the paragraph id you can obtain the segment pairs of that paragraph UpdateSegmentPair - updates the document with the specified segment pair UpdateSegmentPairProperties - updates the document with the specified segment pair properties UpdateParagraphProperties - updates the document with the specified paragraph properties CRUD operations on comments Adding comments was only possible using Billingual API . While this is fine when you want to do it for your custom file type is not productive to use it when you just want to add comments to your well known file type. To solve this issue the integration api has now specialized methods that allow CRUD operations for comments. Here’s the list with the methods available: AddCommentOnSegment UpdateCommentOnSegment DeleteCommentOnSegment DeleteAllCommentsOnSegment Change segment confirmation level Developers are now able to change the segment confirmation level using the integration API and also they can now subscribe to an event that is trigger when the confirmation level is changed. AutoSuggest provider icon Developer can now add custom icons for their AutoSuggest providers. Segment Content ready There are situations where you may want to do some additional work after the translation has been done. To cover this type of situation the event ActiveSegmentContentIsReady was added to the Document class. Please leave a comment if you have any questions.

I’m a developer, why bother with translation industry? Configure OpenExchange development environment I’m a translator do I need to write code? The short answer is yes. In order to make an SDL Studio plugin and publish it on the SDL OpenExchange you need to write code. SDL Studio is developed using Microsoft technology called Microsoft .Net . The platform allows you to build all kind of apps from desktop (like Studio) to web and mobile. Scott Hanselman , principal program manager and community architect at Microsoft, estimates that there are ~8 million .net developers out there. The Microsoft .Net platform has support for many programming languages but the most popular is C# (CSharp). I would recommend learning this language because you will be able to find many resources to help you in your learning journey. Why should I bother? This is a tough one to answer since every person is different and there is no silver bullet answer. Something that resonates with one person might not resonate for someone else. So here’s my list of reasons that might help you answer this question: Are you waiting for a feature to be added in the software? Take the responsibility into your own hands and fix it. You will feel accomplished after you’ve done it, you will gain recognition in the industry and why not even see if you can earn some extra money with it. Everyone Should Learn To Program, But Not Everyone Should Be A Programmer What if only writers could write and when you needed to write an email to your boss you had to ask the company writer do it? I agree that programming and writing are not the same thing but what I’m trying to say is that learning to program doesn’t necessarily mean you became a professional developer. There’s much more than just writing code to being a professional developer. Nowadays learning to write code is much easier than it was 5, 10 or 20 years ago. You have much better tooling and the languages are much more abstract, meaning you don’t need to know all the details of how the computer works in order to write a line of code. There is a strong movement for every child to learn how to program. This doesn’t mean everyone should become a developer but it’s the best way to promote computational thinking . Computational thinking teaches you how to tackle large problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable problems. I hope this will help you understand why should you bother to learn to program (or write code). Where do I start? The first thing you need to start writing apps for the SDL OpenExchange is Microsoft Visual Studio. This is the tool of choice when writing code for the Microsoft .Net platform. The good news is that you can get a free version with all the features you need. This version is called the Visual Studio Community Edition and can be downloaded from here . You can select the 2015 or 2013 version, both of them are suitable for creating SDL OpenExchange plugins. 2015 has only just been released and contains lots of new features for experienced developers. The next step would be to start learning some basics of programming in C#. There are books you can read, but personally I like watching videos so here’s some courses you could look into: C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners This will walk you through all the code examples you need to build basic applications using C#. At the time this video was recorded the Visual Studio Community Edition had not been released so this is not mentioned but I recommend you to use it instead of the Visual Studio Express Edition. Software Development Fundamentals This is a very detailed presentation on software development in general not necessarily only with C#. Some of the parts might be a bit advanced and are not essential if the main objective here is to learn some basic programming rather than becoming a programmer. C# Fundamentals with C# 5.0 This is a great video which I highly recommend but it’s different to the first two in my list because you have to pay for this service. You do get over 4000 courses of great quality though! Although watching those videos provides lots of information the best way to really learn is by practice, so I highly suggest you stop the videos and practice what you’ve seen at every opportunity. If you prefer to learn from books I highly recommend C# in depth but I would still suggest you supplement the book with some of the above videos. One last thing, you’re not alone in this so don’t hesitate to ask for help. As I’ve said earlier in the article, there’s a really big .net community. My suggestions would be to ask any questions on the SDL Language Developers community website. Don’t hesitate to ask general programming questions in there even if they are not directly related to any of SDL products. There is the Getting Started area which is just the right place for this type of discussion. Conclusion My best advice is to have patience, practice as much as possible and don’t be afraid to ask. I’m sure the results will come sooner or later. Happy coding. Please leave a comment if you have any questions.

Age of developers - table of contents As I release parts of this series I will update this page with links to the articles. Introduction I’m a translator do I need to write code? I’m a developer, why bother with translation industry? Configure OpenExchange development environment Translation industry I’m a developer, my heart beats 01010101…, so I’m not going to bore you with market shares, revenues and other big numbers about how big this industry is. If you are really curious about this have a look here . What I would like to say is how important this industry is in today’s world and to sustain my affirmation look at these numbers: Only 27% of Internet users speak English 70% of internet traffic comes from non-English native countries 34% of Twitter messages are in English 75% of Facebook users are outside of US Interesting numbers I must say and they clearly show how relevant this industry is. Now some of you might have heard about machine translation but the translation industry is much more than that. It’s about language localization, interpretation and terminology. Technology Now let’s get closer to what we as developers are interested in, which is the technology. Each industry has its own specific terminology so I would like to take this opportunity to briefly explain some of the terms: CAT tools (Computer-Assisted Translation) - typically these are desktop applications that aid translators and linguists to increase their translation productivity. While these applications will continue to be predominant on the desktop, web solutions will slowly appear that will add new options for translators and linguists. Translation Memories - this are databases that store segments, which can be sentences, paragraphs, headings, titles or elements, from any filetype, in a list that has been translated. CAT tools rely on translation memories to aid the translator during the translation. Termbase - this is a central repository, like a database, which allows translators to systematically manage approved terms. Machine translation - this is about automated translation of natural languages. Probably all of you have used free translation or google translate which are the great examples of machine translation at work. The examples I’ve given are just end-user products but each platform exposes machine translation capabilities through various api’s as part of a cloud offering . Post-editing - this is the process of improving a machine generated translation and typically is done from a CAT tool. Why bother? Now that I’ve given you a brief overview of the translation industry the big question is why should I, as a developer, bother getting into this. I already know desktop, web, mobile and/or cloud technologies and I also have to keep up with the fast pace of technology changes. That might be true but if you really want to be a great specialist it’s not enough just to know some technologies, you need to make them relevant. People expect solutions for their problems from developers and good solutions require industry expertise. If someone asks you to build them an accounting system you don’t need to be an expert accountant but you need to know a few things about accounting. I highly recommend reading the article from John Sonmez “ I’m not sure I want to be a specialist ” which emphasizes on specializing as a developer. Becoming a specialist will help you become a better professional, find interesting job opportunities or even become a freelance developer if this is something you’re looking for. Specializing in a specific industry makes perfect sense and this why I consider that you as a developer should take into consideration the translation industry. Where do I start? A great way to learn about the translation industry is to start develop plugins and apps for existing products. The SDL OpenExchange app store is nice way to publish your work and maybe even earn some money. At the very best you will gain exposure as a developer to those translations companies looking for development expertise to help them integrate their own systems or gain some competitive advantage by asking you to implement some ideas of their own. To publish an app on SDL OpenExchange you need to become an SDL OpenExchange developer. This is a simple process you can follow from here . You don’t need to worry about licenses since SDL can offer dedicated developer licenses: CAT Tool - SDL’s CAT tool name is SDL Trados Studio 2015 and in order to develop anything on top if it you’ll need a license. In order to get a developer license please create an SDL OpenExchange developer account and then send an email to app-signing@sdl.com and this will be sorted out Machine Translation - SDL’s machine translation cloud solution is named Language Cloud and you can sign-up for a developer account here . Every new journey might be a bit bumpy in the beginning and you should not hesitate to ask for help. I recommend to register in the language developer community and ask for help there. Conclusion My best advice is to have patience, practice as much as possible and don’t be afraid to ask. I’m sure the results will come sooner or later. Happy coding.

Age of developers - table of contents As I release parts of this series I will update this page with links to the articles. Introduction I’m a translator do I need to write code? I’m a developer, why bother with translation industry? Configure OpenExchange development environment First things first In my previous article I tried to articulate why developing applications or plugins for OpenExchange can bring you benefits regardless if you are a developer or not. Now it’s time to move on and start get our hands dirty. Before starting any development you need to prepare your machine/laptop and based on which Studio(2014 or 2015) version are you going to use the configuration might be a bit different but let’s take it step by step: Operating system - Since the development is done using Microsoft .NET at least for the moment this is only possible only on Windows operating systems. The minimum version you should use is Windows Vista SP2 but I highly recommend to try and use Windows 7 or later. If you want to develop on Windows server that’s fine but you need to have at least Windows Server 2008 SP2. SDL Product - At the moment you can build applications around a few SDL products like Multiterm, Passolo or Studio. Based on which plugin you want to build you will need a licensed product. Now if you don’t have a license don’t worry because if you register here and join the SDL Developer Program we can help you with the licenses you need for development. SDK - You can download the SDK for the product you’re looking to develop from here . Now before going forward I would like to clarify what exactly you get and what you don’t get with this SDK’s. The main purpose for the SDK’s is to help the developer in building the application and this why with the SDK you get some code samples, documentation, Microsoft Visual Studio project templates (2012, 2013 and soon 2015) and build targets that are used by Microsoft Visual Studio to create your sdlplugin file at each build. You won’t get the product API with the SDK since this is already part of the application. Microsoft .Net - This depends on the SDL Studio version you are developing for. SDL Studio 2014 uses .Net framework 4.0.3 and SDL Studio 2015 uses .Net framewrok 4.5.2. Based on the operating system you might already have .net installed on your machine. Microsoft Visual Studio - For SDL Studio 2014 development you can use any version of Visual Studio starting from Visual Studio 2010 and for SDL Studio 2015 you need to use Visual Studio 2013 or later. I highly recommend to use Visual Studio 2013 or 2015. For this 2 versions you can use the community edition which is completely free and offers the same features like the professional version. More details about it here . There aren’t a lot of things to be installed and configured but it might take some time to install all of them. Version control A version control system allows you to track the changes you’ve done to a file or a set of files. It is also backing up your files on some server/cloud. A few people might say that this is not necessary for small projects because it’s an overhead. This might be true but there are plenty of other reasons to do it: Files are backed up on a server/cloud and in case your machine crashes you don’t loose all your work. Every change you make to a file is tracked and version-ed. This means you can always rollback to a previous version if you’ve done something bad in your current version. What do you do if you have multiple development machines, like a desktop and a laptop? Synchronizing between them can give you lot’s of headaches. There are free solutions like github or visual studio online . Now github is free for as many users as you like as long as your project is public (you should consider open source licensing in this case). Visual Studio online is free but only for the 5 users. I’m pretty sure that one of this options will fit your needs. Conclusion Please leave a comment if you have any questions.

It was clear from the beginning that we need to provide some metrics that will help translators understand how they are performing but we also wanted to make it in a fun way. We ended with a few ideas which we then refined with sales and marketing teams from SDL and started the work. I'm happy to say that you can now see the results on OpenExchange as #YourProductivity application. #YourProductivity The #YourProductivity application has 2 main components. One is the SDL Studio plugin that you can get download from here . Once the download is finished all you have to do is double click the file and follow the steps to install the plugin. The second component is a leaderboard web application that can be access from here . Now let me explain a bit each of this 2 components SDL Studio plugin Once you install the plugin when you will go in the SDL Studio editor view you will see a new section in the ribbon, after the project settings, named #YourProductivity. There are 3 buttons available in this section: Productivity score - this will open the productivity score window where you will be able to find all the information about your productivity. Share - this will open a window which will allow you to share the score on the leaderboard and on twitter. In order to share your score you will need to configure your twitter account. Leaderboard - this will open, in your default web browser, the leaderboard web application. As you probably realized the central point is the productivity score window where you will be able to find all the productivity metrics and the score you can share on the leaderboard to enter the competition. Yes you’ve heard correctly there is also a competition and prizes bot more on that a bit later. A picture is worth a thousand words so have a look at the next screen shot and I will explain some of the elements you can find in that screen. On the top left-hand side you can find your score that you can share on the leaderboard and if you configured your twitter account then you will also see the icon and your name. I want to point out the fact that you can use this app without configuring the twitter account but in this case you will not be able to share the score or see your twitter image and name. Also the only information that is shared on the leaderboard is the score on the left-hand side, all the other information is just for you, saved on the local machine, and is meant to help you understand how well you are taking advantage of the productivity features provided by SDL Studio. The translation efficiency percentage is the main indicator of that. You can also find a list of all the projects you’ve worked on, together with the files you’ve touched during the translation. For each file you can find information on how many characters where inserted during translation process,this includes characters from TM’s or AT, how many keystrokes you’ve used and how efficient you were on that specific file. You should aim to have the keystrokes saved number as high as possible. Leaderboard The leaderboard is a public web application, so you can have a look at it even if you haven’t shared anything on it. Based on the scores on the leaderboard at the end of each month the top 3 positions, along with 4 lucky users selected at random, will receive Amazon gift cards worth up to €150. At the end of each month both the leaderboard and the information you find in the SDL Studio plugin will be cleared so if you didn’t get a chance in the competition this month you can definitely do it next month. Conclusion This is the first release of the application, we already have some ideas for the next version but it would be great to get some feedback from you. If you want to learn more about the app and how it was build you can find me in Amsterdam in the week starting with 14th of September for the SDL Open House and Hackathon . "}]}
