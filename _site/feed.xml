<p class="dropcap">I love writing code, something I’ve probably said before in other articles. Writing code means dealing with all sorts of API's all day long, starting from your development platform, in my case <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net" target="_blank">Micrososft .Net</a>, to different applications or platform API's. In my humble opinion, in today's world it's all about API's and if I were deciding to buy a piece of software for a company I wouldn't consider any that didn't come with some sort of development experience. I might not need it today but it's definitely going to pay off in the long term. After all, who wants to buy or use a product that doesn't offer flexibility? Based on the type of product, API's can come in multiple forms, for example these days SAAS products tend to offer some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transferREST" target="_blank">REST API</a> which can be consumed in different ways and devices. For the traditional, desktop type products the API is composed from certain classes, events and contracts that allow you to either hook into a particular process or to extend their user interface to some degree. As you probably figured out already, I’m going to talk about the SDL Studio API's in this article but let’s consider specifically that word "Public" … how does it differ from "Private"?</p>

<h3 id="public-vs-private-api">Public vs Private API</h3>

<p>The internet is full of debates on this topic trying to figure out pros and cons for this approach. My take on this is that there is no silver bullet solution and the decision should be made based on the specific context of the application/product, how the API is bringing value to the product and the impact on product delivery.</p>

<p>SDL Studio comes with a public API which I will explain in detail in a bit but you might ask yourself why aren’t all the application components public? At the end of the day the product is just a bunch of assemblies/dll’s that I can easily consume from my code/application. From a strictly technical standpoint this is absolutely correct but other things have to be taken in consideration. Certain parts, that are considered internal, are changing quite often and that means the application/plugin that depends on those components might be broken with every change that’s made, also there are areas that were not necessarily built to be extensible (at least not for the moment). For SDL Studio the benefit of having a clearly defined public API is the guarantee that changes are made in a controlled manner. Of course bugs may still pop-up as in any piece of software but we won’t remove or change things overnight just because we need them in a certain way to develop a new feature or fix a bug.</p>

<h3 id="the-sdl-studio-public-apis">The SDL Studio public API’s</h3>

<p>At the time I’m writing this article SDL Studio comes with six public API’s. We are also at the point to release two new public API’s (<a href="https://community.sdl.com/developers/language-developers/f/61/t/6451">More details</a>). For a clear understanding of each of the available API’s in the following lines I will enumerate them and give some details about each of them together with the corresponding assemblies that you need to include in your application:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/Core/4.0/html/ecbcf309-0686-4cc0-85ef-a8963f73d369.htm">Core API</a></strong></p>

<p><code>This is the foundation which provides the plug-in framework available in SDL Studio. This is used by other API's to define extension points inside the host application which in this case is SDL Studio. You can use this libraries inside another host application if you are looking for a plugin framework and you want to provide this type feature. Besides the plug-in framework this API provides also the engine besides the settings mechanism you find inside SDL Studio</code></p>

<p>In order to use the API you will need to reference the following assemblies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sdl.Core.Globalization.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.Core.PluginFramework.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.Core.Settings.dll</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/FileTypeSupport/4.0/html/1f5584af-9763-46ff-894b-08127a2421a7.htm">File Type Support API</a></strong></p>

<p><code>In order to translate the content from a certain file type SDL Studio extracts the content into a billingual file type called SDLXliff. Out of the box SDL Studio comes with a comprehensive list of file types that are supported but in case you have a particular file type that is not supported you can use this API to extract the content and create the SDLXliff needed for translation. Also you can extend existing file type to handle certain use case that might not work as expected. This API is also used by the out of the box filters.</code></p>

<p>In order to use the API you will need to reference the following assemblies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sdl.FileTypeSupport.Framework.Core.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.FileTypeSupport.Framework.Core.Utilities.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.FileTypeSupport.Framework.Core.Settings.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.FileTypeSupport.Framework.PreviewControls.dll</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/ProjectAutomationApi/4.0/html/b986e77a-82d2-4049-8610-5159c55fddd3.htm">Project Automation API</a></strong></p>

<p><code>There are many activities that must be done as part of the translation process and this is why SDL Studio provides project management features such analysis, pre-translation, generation of finalized target documents,etc. Using the Project Automation API you can build a customized translation workflow based on activities specific to your needs.</code></p>

<p>In order to use the API you will need to reference the following assemblies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sdl.ProjectAutomation.Core.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.ProjectAutomation.FileBased.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.ProjectAutomation.Settings.dll</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/TranslationMemoryApi/4.0/html/790076c4-fb7c-4c3d-9ad5-e7691c317500.htm">Translation Memory API</a></strong></p>

<p><code>Translation memories are an essenctial piece of technology for translators. Of course SDL Studio comes with this capabilities but in case you want to use a different piece of technology for translation memories you can enable that in SDL Studio by creating a new translation memory provider using the Translation Memory API.</code></p>

<p>In order to use the API you will need to reference the following assemblies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sdl.LanguagePlatform.Core.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemory.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.LanguagePlatform.IO.dll</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/StudioIntegrationApi/4.0/html/135dcb1c-535b-46a9-8063-b83be4a06d82.htm">Integration API</a></strong></p>

<p><code>This API enables 3rd party developers to extend or customize the user interface or create custom functionalities for SDL Studio. To be more specific you can create new views, new sections in the menu ribbon, new buttons in the menu ribbon, new options in the context menu or hook into the editor to create, update or delete certain informations or you can get notified when certain events happen.</code></p>

<p>In order to use the API you will need to reference the following assemblies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sdl.DesktopEditor.BasicControls.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.DesktopEditor.EditorApi.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.Desktop.IntegrationApi.Extensions.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.TranslationStudioAutomation.Licensing.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.TranslationStudioAutomation.IntegrationApi.dll</li>
  <li>Sdl.TranslationStudioAutomation.IntegrationApi.Extensions.dll</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/Verification/4.0/html/4bc459fe-8ca2-4686-8764-616ebb5ce526.htm">Verification API</a></strong></p>

<p><code>SDL Studio allows translators to check their work by runining verifiers during translation. There can be many ways to verify the quality of a translation and it can also become verify specific so to cope with that need SDL Studio allows custom verifiers to be build and run.</code></p>

<p>In order to use the API you will need to reference the following assemblies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sdl.Verification.Api.dll</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://community.sdl.com/developers/language-developers/f/61/t/6451">Batch Task API</a></strong></p>

<p><code>As part of project management workflow there certain tasks that must happen, like pre-translation, analysis and so on. SDL Studio is coming with a predefined set of tasks but you also create your custom tasks that can be included in your workflows. This API is linked to the Project Automation API but since it's a new addition it's worth mention it separately.</code></p>

<p>In order to use the API you will need to reference the following assemblies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sdl.ProjectAutomation.AutomaticTasks.dll</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://community.sdl.com/developers/language-developers/f/61/t/6451">Terminology Provider API</a></strong></p>

<p><code>Multiterm is the defacto technology for handling terminology in SDL Studio. This API allows 3rd party developers to enable different terminology technology in SDL Studio by creating new terminology providers.</code></p>

<p>In order to use the API you will need to reference the following assemblies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sdl.Terminology.TerminologyProvider.Core.dll</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of the API’s I’ve listed the corresponding assemblies but based on your needs you can combine them. A plugin might have dll’s from Core API combined with dll’s from Project Automation API.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>

<h3 id="why-should-i-come">Why should I come?</h3>

<p>Well there are plenty of reasons to come, like meeting fellow developers from other companies (some of you might not be attracted by this but trust me it’s nice to learn about what others are doing), having a coffee (or beer shhhtt…) and maybe, just maybe, if you are not too tired by that time hear what the speakers have to say.</p>

<h3 id="whos-speaking">Who’s speaking?</h3>

<p>There are two session schedule for this event. One of the session is going to be presented by Radu Vunvulea, checkout his <a href="http://vunvulearadu.blogspot.ro/">Tech Wall</a> for more details, and the second is going to be presented by me. I guess if you end up reading this article you probably know me but if you somehow find this by mistake just click around and you might get some info about me.</p>

<h3 id="the-sessions">The sessions</h3>

<p><strong>First 13 steps to be able to design an application for Azure Service Fabric</strong> - Radu Vunvulea</p>

<p><code>This presentation will introduce you in the most important concept of Azure Service Fabric with real life examples and demos. This is not a how to session, this is a session with the pillars of Azure Service Fabric.</code></p>

<p><strong>Building my first mobile app with UWP</strong> - Romulus Crisan</p>

<p><code>Nowadays all sorts of devices are popping up into our lives and being a developer I’m intrigued by the idea of customizing or building apps for this type of devices. As you all know perfectly our time is limited and since I make my living out of Microsoft technology until recently the only real option to tinker with this devices was to learn a new technology. Personally I loved the idea of learning something completely new but my boss and my family decide against it. Last year Microsoft launched the new Universal Windows Platform and I thought that this is my “breakout” ticket since I already know most of the technology, or at least I thought I knew it … . So in this session I want to share my experience on building my first mobile application using Microsoft Universal Windows Platform. To be more specific I will talk about tools, data binding and layouts.</code></p>

<p>Hope to see you there.</p>

  <li>About SDL Studio SDK</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-is-an-sdk">What is an SDK?</h3>

<p>SDK stands for <strong>software development kit</strong> and typically is a set of software development tools that enable the creation of applications for certain software applications. What exactly an SDK contains differ between each target software applications. Sometimes it can be a set of libraries in certain programming languages, like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net">Microsoft .Net</a> or <a href="https://www.java.com">Java</a>, or it can also contain a bunch of supporting tools. Typically the SDK comes as a separate download since not every user might be interested in using this type of capabilities.If you are interested to read more details you can have a look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-can-find-inside-the-sdl-studio-sdk">What I can find inside the SDL Studio SDK?</h3>

<p>SDL Studio SDK comes as a separate download from the standard SDL Studio application. You can get it from the developer page located <a href="http://www.translationzone.com/openexchange/developer/sdk.html">here</a>. Now let’s see what goodies we get with the SDK:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Sample applications, developed in C#, to demonstrate the basic capabilities of SDL Studio API’s. This applications are really good to get you started with one of the API’s but please bare in mind that they don’t cover the entire API’s feature set so please also look for features in the <a href="http://www.translationzone.com/openexchange/developer/sdk.html">documention</a> or ask on our <a href="https://community.sdl.com/developers/language-developers/">developer community</a>. After the SDL Studio SDK is installed you can find the samples located under the <code>c:\ProgramData\SDL\SDK {Version}\</code> folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Microsoft Visual Studio project templates. This templates are very useful when you start developing a new plugin for SDL Studio because you just select the template that is appropriate for the API you want to use.
<img src="/assets/images/posts/sdl-project-vs-templates.png" alt="sdl-project-vs-templates.png" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-is-not-part-of-the-sdl-studio-sdk">What is not part of the SDL Studio SDK?</h3>

<p>At this point you might wonder a bit why the previous section didn’t mention anything about the <strong>API libraries</strong> since typically this libraries come with the SDK. The reason I didn’t mention them is because they are installed together with SDL Studio. There is a simple and good reason why they are distributed with the product and this is because some of the default SDL Studio features are developed using this API’s. To give you some good examples all out-of-the-box filters are developed on top of the same <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/FileTypeSupport/4.0/">File Type Support Framework</a>, also each translation provider is built using the same <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/TranslationMemoryApi/4.0/">Translation Memory API</a>.</p>

<p>Distributing the API libraries together with the product has some pros and cons. The main disadvantage is that we are not able to provide new features in the API libraries on a different pace than the product releases. A big advantage is that the API’s that are used for default features are well tested and mature.</p>

<p>At this point I need to mention that not all API libraries are used for default features. For example the <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/StudioIntegrationApi/4.0/">Intergration API</a> is just a wrapper on top of internal components.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-to-install-the-sdk">Do I need to install the SDK?</h3>

<p>If the <strong>API libraries</strong> are distributed with the product a valid questions pops up and that is if I need to install the SDK. The answer is no but I highly recommend it. It is possible to develop a plugin for SDL Studio without having the SDK installed on your machine is just that it will take more time to setup your Visual Studio project. First of all you will have to specify all the SDL Studio API libraries you need. This is pretty straightforward task but the complicated bit is to create the <code>.sdlplugin</code> file. You will have to manually edit the Visual Studio project file and add the msbuild targets to create the <code>.sdlplugin</code> package.</p>

<h3 id="future-plans">Future plans</h3>

<p>I have to say that SDL Studio SDK is kind of slim in terms of the tooling that is providing to the developers and it doesn’t make too much sense to keep it in the current form. There other better ways in which we can provide the current content so the future plans are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Move sample applications to Github. This gives us a few benefits like better search-ability, improvements and fixes can be done by anyone interested not just SDL internal developers and of course it will still be available to download locally as a zip file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create more specific Visual Studio project templates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide Visual Studio project templates as Visual Studio extension. Initially this will probably be available only for Visual Studio 2015 and based on the need we will make it available for older versions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I believe this changes will make the SDK more open and closer to the developer. Of course when all the above points will be done the current installer will probably disappear.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.</p>

<p class="dropcap">I love small and simple things that help me be more productive with my work. This is the main reasons why some time ago I started to work on <a href="https://github.com/sdl/groupsharekit.net" target="_blank">GroupShareKit</a> and I'm now happy to say that this is now available for everyone to use it as they like. Not only that you can use it but is completely open source.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-groupsharekit">What is GroupShareKit?</h3>

<p>GroupShareKit is a client library targeting .NET 4.5 and above that provides an easy way to interact with <a href="http://sdldevelopmentpartners.sdlproducts.com/documentation/api">GroupShare Rest API</a>. This library will greatly simplify and reduce the work a developer has to do in order to consume resources available in GroupShare by reducing the amount of boilerplate code and configuration that has to be written. This way the developer can focus his time and work on the actual implementation that has to be done.</p>

<p>Another benefit of this library is that you don’t have to actually understand how rest API’s are working since all this will be completely hidden. If you are not sure what an rest API is please have a look <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/2013/11/18/web-apis-for-non-programmers/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-start">How do I start?</h3>

<p>Using GroupShareKit library is very simple and it doesn’t require to run any installer, all you have to do is a few clicks inside Microsoft Visual Studio. The first step you need to do is to open the project where you want to use GroupShareKit in Visual Studio. After the project is opened go in the <code>Solution Explorer</code> area (if you can’t find it just press CTRL+ALT+L inside Visual Studio), then right click on the project <code>References</code> and select <code>Manage Nuget packages...</code>(if you can’t see this option have a look <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/installing-nuget">here</a>). This action will open a window where you need to search for <code>GroupShareKit</code> and once you get the result just click the install button. That’s all, you can start use the GroupShareKit library in your project.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/setting-up-build-automation-net-projects/setting-up-build.jpg" alt="Setting up build automation" title="Setting up build automation" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p class="dropcap">In the last weeks I worked on a .net client library for <a href="http://www.sdl.com/cxc/language/translation-productivity/studio-groupshare/" target="_blank">SDL Studio GroupShare</a>. This new client library is open source and meant to simplify developers work in terms of consuming resources available in GroupShare, but more about this on a future article. As I was coming closer to make a new release of this library I was thinking that it would make perfect sense to automate the build. There are many reasons to do that but for me the most important one was to have a painless mechanism to verify contribution from other developers. I've setup build automation for a few projects but this was my first attempt to do it for an open source project. While the automation concepts are exactly the same as for any other project the tooling involved is a bit different, especially if you are coming from a Microsoft world.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-hosted-building-automation-for-net">Cloud hosted building automation for .NET</h3>

<p>Open source means that your entire source code is publicly available to everyone interested, if it’s not then what’s the point of having it open source? Being public it probably means that you are hosting your code in places like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, honestly nowadays this is probably your best choice. My choice to host the code for the GroupShare client library was <a href="https://github.com/sdl/groupsharekit.net">Github</a> and based on my previous experience my first idea to setup build automation was to prepare a server somewhere that would be able to grab my code and run the build script. While I could have setup a server pretty easy I immediately step backed since I was having the feeling that this approach doesn’t fit the purpose, somehow this doesn’t fit on the open source world. The reason I was having this feeling is because somebody (me) had to invest time, effort and some money to keep the server run. Also there was no simple option to share this with the other developers interested in using or contributing to the library. So I started doing some research and I found out there are a bunch of cloud hosted services that provide build automation and each of them was integrating nicely with Github. The list is pretty long so I’ll share just a few that I found most interesting and popular among other developers: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>, <a href="https://codeship.com/">Codeship</a> and <a href="https://drone.io/">Drone.io</a>. Awesome, just that none of them had support for Windows environments and my library was .net and I was not using either <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/12/04/introducing-net-core.aspx">.Net core</a>. So in my mind I was thinking that I should turn my attention to what Microsoft has to offer in terms of build automation since I’m pretty sure they’ll support Windows environments. I knew Microsoft had TFS Build as part of their on-premise enterprise solution and I also knew about their relatively new <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs.aspx">visual studio online</a> offering which should include also build automation. <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs.aspx">Visual studio online</a>  does offer this capability and can also be configured to grab the code from github, more about his <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/vs/alm/Build/github/index?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396">here</a>. Awesome again, just that this feature is not completely free and unfortunately the pricing model is not simple and friendly to understand. So again I had to continue looking for other options and I finally found <a href="http://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> which is completely free for open source projects and it’s supporting Windows environments, actually they market themselves as <code>... Continuous Integration and Deployment tools to every .NET developer ...</code>. It’s pretty obviously that my choice was <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs.aspx">Visual studio online</a> because … errr not. I choose <a href="http://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> because of obvious reasons, but it’s a shame that Microsoft doesn’t have a simple free offering for open source projects given the recent strong movement towards open source.</p>

<h3 id="build-scripting">Build scripting</h3>

<p>At this point I had my source code on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and choose <a href="http://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> to run my builds. Linking them together was easy since <a href="http://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> allows you to log in with your <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> credentials and once you authorize <a href="http://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> it’s just a matter of choosing the repository for which you want to build. At this point I highly recommend looking to the <a href="http://www.appveyor.com/docs">AppVeyor documentation</a> if you are not familiar with the platform.</p>

<p>After the linking was done <a href="http://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> requires that you repository to have <code>appveyor.yml</code> file from which you can configure which build environment, deploy mechanism and build scripts to run. Since in my case the requirements where simple I pretty much left the default configuration. I only specified my build script:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/03a1ba3d5cf4531f0152.js"></script>

<p>As you can see from my above script I basically run my cmd <a href="https://www.google.ro/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=cmd%20script&amp;oq=cmd%20scri&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.3162j0j7">Windows batch script</a> specifying two different targets one for building my library and one for run a few integration tests. The batch script is a bit more complicated at the first look but is really simple actually. The first step is to use <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">Nuget</a> to install to additional libraries that I need to run the build. First is <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/">Fake</a>, more about this in a bit, and the XUnit test runner console that I need to run my integration tests since I’m using XUnit for testing instead of MS Tests.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/02318ab4b34c76d19cdb.js"></script>

<p>Creating build automation script is not something that the .Net developer has to do and this is because the wonderful job done for him by Visual Studio. That is slowly changing because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">CI</a> practice. To build a .net project/solution you need run <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171452.aspx">msbuild</a> (this is what Visual Studio does behind the scenes). MSBuild is extensible and you can alter the build process based on your need but the syntax is pretty complicated and verbose (completely written in xml), personally I don’t necessarily like it. Apparently I was not the only who didn’t like working directly with msbuild so the community created libraries to simplify the build process. This type of libraries are using a domain specific language based on a well know programming, like <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake</a> using ruby or <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a>/<a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> using java-script. Any of this libraries can be used to create a .net build script since they have dedicated plugins from msbuild but you’ll have to add a new dependency on your build system. For rake you will have to install ruby and for grunt/gulp you will need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs</a>. Based on the same concept I found 2 other libraries based on .Net programming language which didn’t require additional dependencies. One is named <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/">fake</a> using F# and <a href="https://github.com/sakeproject/sake">sake</a> using C#. Initially I was tempted to use sake because I feel much comfortable writing in C# and I’ve seen it’s used by Microsoft in their open source repositories but it’s not well documented so I decided to use fake. I’m not an F# developer so the syntax seems kind of weird to me but it doesn’t matter that much since you only need some basics and you can of course copy from other examples. For the GroupShare client library I ended up with this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/57efc7eee344e84cdb8c.js"></script>

<p>Looks a bit scary at first but just walk through it line by line and it will start make sense, especially if you’ve done some work with msbuild. First 23 lines are just setting a bunch of values and then defining some msbuild targets using fake dsl language. Name of the targets are meaningful for what they are doing.</p>

<h3 id="handling-sensitive-data">Handling sensitive data</h3>

<p>In an open source project all your information has to be public including your configuration settings, like api keys, user name or passwords. For example your application might use a mailing platform like <a href="http://www.mailgun.com/">mailigun</a> for which you have your own account which you don’t want to be shared with everyone. In a private project you don’t need to worry to much about this because typically this type of information end up in configuration file that can be accessed only by authorized people. Also you might run some integration tests as part of your build for which you might need some api key’s or credentials. The solution I found for handling sensitive data is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable">environment variables</a>. This are easy to configure on your machine, testing machine(s) and all of the build platforms allow configuring environment variables from and administrative panel.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I hope this will give you a much clearer picture about options you have in terms of cloud hosted build platforms you can use for your project, especially open source. One thing I have to mention that each of the build platforms have offerings for non open source projects but for those you’ll have to pay.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.</p>

<p class="dropcap">GroupShare is a collaboration platform for translation teams that is helping streamline translation processes, reduce coordination efforts and offer a secure access to all in-house and external resources. I'm not going to get into details about GroupShare but if you want to know more have a look <a href="http://www.translationzone.com/products/sdl-studio-groupshare/" target="_blank">here</a>.

While this is good enough in most of the situations there are customers that already have a system where they store users and would like to use that instead of having different users in various systems. To overcome this need GroupShare allows implementation of custom authentication providers.</p>

<h3 id="custom-authentication-provider">Custom authentication provider</h3>

<p>In order to implement a custom authentication provider you will have to implement a GroupShare plugin. Building such a plugin is very similar experience to building an SDL Studio plugin. Since GroupShare is built using Microsoft .NET you will have to use the Microsoft development platform and to be more specific for GroupShare 2015 you will need to use Microsoft .NET 4.5.2 version. The tool of choice for doing Microsoft .NET development is <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a>. You can use any flavor of Visual Studio (including the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs">free community edition</a>) but since you need to build your plugin for Microsoft .NET 4.5.2 you will have to use Visual Studio 2013 or later. Here are the steps you need to follow to create the plugin:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using Visual Studio create a new project of type Class Library.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Add reference to the following assemblies (both can be found under <code>SDL Server\Application</code> folder of your GroupShare install location):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Sdl.Core.PluginFramework.dll</p>

      <p>Sdl.StudioServer.Api.Core.dll</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Add a new class to the project and name it accordingly to your needs.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the newly created class and decorate it with the attribute <code>CustomAuthenticationProviderExtention</code>. Also set attribute property <code>CanValidateUserExistance</code> to true.</p>

    <p><code>[CustomAuthenticationProviderExtention(CanValidateUserExistance = true)]</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>Inherit the newly created class from <code>ICustomAuthenticationProvider</code>. This will require to create 2 methods in your class <code>UserExists</code> and <code>ValidateCredentials</code>.</li>
  <li>Implemented this 2 new methods with your custom authentication logic.</li>
  <li>Add a new xml file to your project with the following naming format <code>{yourcustomname}.plugin.xml</code>. This is used to describe the plugin you are building and it will be used by GroupShare to load your plugin. The content of your file has to follow a certain structure. You can use the following example to build yours:</li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/c8083af5d32caa6cdd63.js"></script>

<h3 id="signing">Signing</h3>

<p>Before you can deploy your plugin to GroupShare your plugin assembly must be signed. To sign it please send your plugin assembly to <code>app-signing@sdl.com</code>.</p>

<h3 id="deploy">Deploy</h3>

<p>To deploy your plugin you will have to copy the plugin.xml file described at point 7 to the <code>SDL Server\Application\Plugins</code> folder of your GroupShare install location. Next you need to drop your plugin assembly in the <code>SDL Server\Application</code> folder. If you have other dependencies to your plugin please copy those also to the <code>SDL Server\Application</code> folder.</p>

<h3 id="final-words">Final words</h3>

<p>You can find a complete sample implementation of a custom authentication provider <a href="https://github.com/sdl/Sdl-GroupShare-Custom-Authentication-Provider">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[By this time some of you are already aware of my Age of Developers initiative. This initiative is meant to help everyone which would like to build applications for OpenExchange store or integrate SDL language products in their organization. Another way to learn develop applications for OpenExchange store is by going to a training. Now I have to say this is not something that happens regularly but if there is enough demand it can be arranged. For example last month we had an opportunity for a one day Studio API training at the Saint-Petersburg State University Of Aerospace Instrumentation with students from their language and computer systems faculties. Let me talk a bit about what was covered in this one day training.]]></description>

This initiative is meant to help everyone which would like to build applications for <a href="translationzone.com/openexchange/" target="_blank">OpenExchange store</a> or integrate SDL language products in their organization. Another way to learn develop applications for <a href="translationzone.com/openexchange/" target="_blank">OpenExchange store</a> is by going to a training. Now I have to say this is not something that happens regularly but if there is enough demand it can be arranged. For example last month we had an opportunity for a one day Studio API training at the <a href="http://suai.ru/" target="_blank">Saint-Petersburg State University Of Aerospace Instrumentation</a> with students from their language and computer systems faculties and I would like to briefly share with you what we covered.</p>

<h3 id="what-a-day">What a day</h3>

<p>As a personal opinion I see training’s as a jump-start and eye opener since nobody becomes an expert in one day. In order to become one it requires lots of work, perseverance and patience. Having that said the objective of this training was to familiarize the students with some translation industry concepts, like translation memories, and the Studio API. One really important aspect that I need to mention is that none of them had any previous contacts with the translation industry. Because of this our first part of the training day was focused on showing and explaining SDL Studio together with API. After this first part we had 3 coding sessions in which each of the participant worked on the same <a href="https://github.com/sdl/Sdl-Community/tree/master/Record%20Source%20TU">application</a> on his development machine. In two of the sessions they were following me as I was writing parts of the applications and in the third (last) session they worked in small teams of 3 people to try and implement the final bits.</p>

<p>Well this is not about the training but it was my first time in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=saint%20petersburg">Saint-Petersburg</a> and Russia. It’s a really nice town which I highly recommend to visit if you have the chance. People are very nice and there are plenty of <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g298507-Activities-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html">things to do</a>. I know I would like to have the chance to go again</p>

<p class="dropcap">A few months back during a brainstorm session me an and <a href="http://multifarious.filkin.com/" target="_blank">Paul Filkin</a> where playing with some ideas on how we could help translators improve their productivity. It was clear from the beginning that we need to provide some metrics that will help translators understand how they are performing but we also wanted to make it in a fun way. We ended with a few ideas which we then refined with sales and marketing teams from SDL and started the work. I'm happy to say that you can now see the results on OpenExchange as <a href="http://www.translationzone.com/openexchange/app/yourproductivity-861.html#88985" target="_blank">#YourProductivity</a> application.</p>

<h3 id="yourproductivity">#YourProductivity</h3>

<p>The #YourProductivity application has 2 main components. One is the SDL Studio plugin that you can get download from <a href="http://www.translationzone.com/openexchange/app/yourproductivity-861.html#88985">here</a>. Once the download is finished all you have to do is double click the file and follow the steps to install the plugin. The second component is a leaderboard  web application that can be access from <a href="http://www.translationzone.com/community/app/community-productivity/">here</a>. Now let me explain a bit each of this 2 components</p>

<h3 id="sdl-studio-plugin">SDL Studio plugin</h3>

<p>Once you install the plugin when you will go in the SDL Studio editor view you will see a new section in the ribbon, after the project settings, named #YourProductivity. There are 3 buttons available in this section:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Productivity score</strong> - this will open the productivity score window where you will be able to find all the information about your productivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Share</strong> - this will open a window which will allow you to share the score on the leaderboard and on twitter. In order to share your score you will need to configure your twitter account.</li>
  <li><strong>Leaderboard</strong> - this will open, in your default web browser, the leaderboard web application.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you probably realized the central point is the <em>productivity score</em> window where you will be able to find all the productivity metrics and the score you can share on the leaderboard to enter the competition. Yes you’ve heard  correctly there is also a competition and prizes bot more on that a bit later. A picture is worth a thousand words so have a look at the next screen shot and I will explain some of the elements you can find in that screen.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/yourproductivity/productivity-score.png" alt="Productivity Score" title="Productivity Score" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>On the top left-hand side you can find your score that you can share on the leaderboard and if you configured your twitter account then you will also see the icon and your name. I want to point out the fact that you can use this app without configuring the twitter account but in this case you will not be able to share the score or see your twitter image and name. Also the only information that is shared on the leaderboard is the score on the left-hand side, all the other information is just for you, saved on the local machine, and is meant to help you understand how well you are taking advantage of the productivity features provided by SDL Studio. The <em>translation efficiency</em> percentage is the main indicator of that. You can also find a list of all the projects you’ve worked on, together with the files you’ve touched during the translation. For each file you can find information on how many characters where inserted during translation process,this includes characters from TM’s or AT, how many keystrokes you’ve used and how efficient you were on that specific file. You should aim to have the <em>keystrokes saved</em> number as high as possible.</p>

<h3 id="leaderboard">Leaderboard</h3>

<p>The leaderboard is a public web application, so you can have a look at it even if you haven’t shared anything on it. Based on the scores on the leaderboard at the end of each month the top 3 positions, along with 4 lucky users selected at random, will receive Amazon gift cards worth up to €150.</p>

<p>At the end of each month both the leaderboard and the information you find in the SDL Studio plugin will be cleared so if you didn’t get a chance in the competition this month you can definitely do it next month.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is the first release of the application, we already have some ideas for the next version but it would be great to get some feedback from you.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about the app and how it was build you can find me in Amsterdam in the week starting with 14th of September for the <a href="https://community.sdl.com/products-solutions/language/translationproductivity/c/e/102?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvq7KcO%2FhmjTEU5z17%2BgtWaCwhokz2EFye%2BLIHETpodcMT8JlNbzYDBceEJhqyQJxPr3DJNkN1tloRhTgDQ%3D%3D">SDL Open House</a> and <a href="https://community.sdl.com/events/sdl_community_open_sept_2015_amsterdam/c/e/65?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvq7KcO%2FhmjTEU5z17%2BgtWaCwhokz2EFye%2BLIHETpodcMT8JlNbzYDBceEJhqyQJxPr3DJNkN1tloRhTgDQ%3D%3D">Hackathon</a>.</p>

<h3 id="first-things-first">First things first</h3>

<p>In my previous article I tried to articulate why developing applications or plugins for OpenExchange can bring you benefits regardless if you are a developer or not. Now it’s time to move on and start get our hands dirty. Before starting any development you need to prepare your machine/laptop and based on which Studio(2014 or 2015) version are you going to use the configuration might be a bit different but let’s take it step by step:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Operating system</strong> - Since the development is done using Microsoft .NET at least for the moment this is only possible only on Windows operating systems. The minimum version you should use is Windows Vista SP2 but I highly recommend to try and use Windows 7 or later. If you want to develop on Windows server that’s fine but you need to have at least Windows Server 2008 SP2.</li>
  <li><strong>SDL Product</strong> - At the moment you can build applications around a few SDL products like Multiterm, Passolo or Studio. Based on which plugin you want to build you will need a licensed product. Now if you don’t have a license don’t worry because if you register <a href="http://www.translationzone.com/openexchange/developer/">here</a> and join the SDL Developer Program we can help you with the licenses you need for development.</li>
  <li><strong>SDK</strong> - You can download the SDK for the product you’re looking to develop from <a href="http://www.translationzone.com/openexchange/developer/sdk.html">here</a>. Now before going forward I would like to clarify what exactly you get and what you don’t get with this SDK’s. The main purpose for the SDK’s is to help the developer in building the application and this why with the SDK you get some code samples, documentation, Microsoft Visual Studio project templates (2012, 2013 and soon 2015) and build targets that are used by Microsoft Visual Studio to create your <em>sdlplugin</em> file at each build. You won’t get the product API with the SDK since this is already part of the application.</li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft .Net</strong> - This depends on the SDL Studio version you are developing for. SDL Studio 2014 uses .Net framework 4.0.3 and SDL Studio 2015 uses .Net framewrok 4.5.2. Based on the operating system you might already have .net installed on your machine.</li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft Visual Studio</strong> - For SDL Studio 2014 development you can use any version of Visual Studio starting from Visual Studio 2010 and for SDL Studio 2015 you need to use Visual Studio 2013 or later. I highly recommend to use Visual Studio 2013 or 2015. For this 2 versions you can use the community edition which is completely free and offers the same features like the professional version. More details about it <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>There aren’t a lot of things to be installed and configured but it might take some time to install all of them.</p>

<h3 id="version-control">Version control</h3>

<p>A version control system allows you to track the changes you’ve done to a file or a set of files. It is also backing up your files on some server/cloud. A few people might say that this is not necessary for small projects because it’s an overhead. This might be true but there are plenty of other reasons to do it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Files are backed up on a server/cloud and in case your machine crashes you don’t loose all your work.</li>
  <li>Every change you make to a file is tracked and version-ed. This means you can always rollback to a previous version if you’ve done something bad in your current version.</li>
  <li>What do you do if you have multiple development machines, like a desktop and a laptop? Synchronizing between them can give you lot’s of headaches.</li>
  <li>There are free solutions like <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> or <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-online-pricing-vs.aspx">visual studio online</a>. Now github is free for as many users as you like as long as your project is public (you should consider open source licensing in this case). Visual Studio online is free but only for the 5 users. I’m pretty sure that one of this options will fit your needs.</li>
</ol>
