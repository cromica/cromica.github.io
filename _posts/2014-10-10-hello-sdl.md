summary: "I now have two weeks since I joined SDL as a <i>Language Platform Evangelist Developer</i>. Almost everyone asked me what does that mean and what will I do so I decided that I better explain here in detail. If you are looking for a general definition of the position you can find one on wikipedia but it won't help you too much. In order to understand it better you really need to understand the context."

### Who is SDL? ###

First off all let me tell you a few words about SDL and what is the company doing. It started as language translation service company and quickly become also a company providing software for language translation. The company growth facilitated various company and product acquires across the years. Acquisitions where on different domains which allowed SDL to re-position itself recently as a [global customer experience management](http://www.sdl.com/solutions/business-need/global-customer-experience-management/) company. If you are looking for more details please have a look [here](http://www.sdl.com/aboutus/aboutsdl/history.html) for the history of the company and [here](http://www.sdl.com/aboutus/aboutsdl/vision-mission.html) for the new vision and mission.

### What I'm going to do at SDL? ###

As I previously said SDL is offering now [global customer experience management](http://www.sdl.com/solutions/business-need/global-customer-experience-management/) and as you might already think when you say global you immediately think of multiple languages, which means translation. 

I'm going to be closely involved in [SDL Trados Studio](http://www.sdl.com/products/sdl-trados-studio/) and [Language Cloud](https://languagecloud.sdl.com/) and probably some other products depending on the needs. Most of my work will be around creating and growing the development community for this products, but I will also offer support and consultancy to clients and help the sale process when is necessary. Growing the development community can mean many things but here are some of they key things I will do:
1. 



Since the major focus of my work will be around the development community will be  For [SDL Trados Studio](http://www.sdl.com/products/sdl-trados-studio/) there is a [Open Exchange](http://www.translationzone.com/openexchange/index.html), but since [Language Cloud](https://languagecloud.sdl.com/) is fairly new where are now working on it.
