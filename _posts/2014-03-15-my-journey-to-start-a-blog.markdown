### The Journey ###

Well I was thinking to start a blog for sometime because of the reasons I've pointed in my first article [Why a blog ?](http://romuluscrisan.com/blog/2014/02/23/why-a-blog.html). This is a technical blog since I will write most of the time about software development and various technologies in an attempt to share my knowledge and experience but also because I want to us it as a brain dump. From time to time I might write about  some other things but probably still around technology. 

Finally this year I started looking for various options to host a blog and I ended up using [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/). Why I made this option I've detailed in my blog post [Why I choose Github pages](http://romuluscrisan.com/blog/2014/02/24/why-i-choose-github-pages.html). Github pages is powered by a very nice and interesting framework called Jekyll for which I wrote an introduction  in my article [The engine behing my blog](http://romuluscrisan.com/blog/2014/03/03/the-engine-behind-my-blog.html). Since my work is most of the time in Microsoft world I had to install Jekyll on Windows which is not necessarily straight forward so I described an easier alternative using chocolatey in my article [Install Jekyll using chocolatey](http://romuluscrisan.com/jekyll/2014/03/06/install-jekyll-using-chocolatey.html).


I'm really glad that finally I manage to start this blog but I guess the real challenge comes now when I will need to actually use it and keep it alive. I hope you will find my journey useful to decide start a blog or if you are already decided to assist in your steps to get the blog started.
