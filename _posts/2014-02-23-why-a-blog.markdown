<p class="dropcap">I was thinking to start a blog for some while but never find the right time.

### The Journey ###

There are quite a few things to think about when deciding to have a blog, like: 

- What will I write about?
 
- What blogging platform should I use?

- Since I'm a developer should I build something of my own? 

- Where I will host it?

- What's the design of the blog ?

There some other smaller things but those where the main questions for me. For the first one I've answered in the first paragraph but let's see a bit about the other questions. First of all I'm not a big [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/ "Wordpress") fan although I've used it in the past. This is not because it's bad rather it's a mater of taste. Next I had a look at [Ghost](https://ghost.org/ "Ghost") which is really interesting and nice. There are some other good blogging platforms like [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/features "Blogger") or [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/ "Tumblr") and I have to admit that it's hard to decide between them but I wanted to have more control so just a blogging platform was a no go for me. Building something of my own was interesting enough but I quickly realize that I don't have enough time to do it so I abandoned the idea. Looking for other option I read [David Ebbo](http://blog.davidebbo.com/about/ "David Ebbo") was [moving his site to Github pages](http://blog.davidebbo.com/2014/01/moving-to-github-pages.html "Moving to GitHub pages") and decided to have a look. I really liked the way Github pages is working and I will tell more about this on future posts.

So at this point my blog is hosted by Github pages and this is just the first version of it. I will add some other features in the next weeks.
