title: SDL Studio public API

<p class="dropcap"> I love writting code and most probably I said it before in other articles. Writting code means dealing with all sorts of API's all day long, starting from your development plaform, in my case <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net" target="_blank">Micrososft .Net</a>, to different application or platform API's. In my humble opinion in today's world it's all about API's and if I were to decide to buy a piece of software for a company I wouldn't consider any which doesn't come with some sort development experience. I might not needed it today but it's definetly going to pay of on a longer term. Who want's to buy or use a product that doesn't offer flexibility? Based on the type of product API's can come in multiple forms, for example SAAS products tend to offer nowadays some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transferREST" target="_blank">REST API</a> and which can be consumed in different ways and devices. For traditional, desktop type, products the API is composed from certain classes, events and contracts that allow you to either hook into a certain process or to extend their user interface to some degree. As you probably figured it out in this article I will talk about the SDL Studio api but what's whit the public word?</p>
