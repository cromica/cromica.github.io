### For blooming developers ###

This are some of the books I recommend for developers which are just starting their career. It's not that they shouldn't read more advanced books but those might be a bit too difficult for the moment.

**[Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)** by [Robert C. Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)

> The book is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) 

**[The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers](http://www.amazon.com/The-Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073)** by [Robert C. Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)

>In The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act. - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073)

**[C# in Depth, 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Depth-3rd-Edition-Jon-Skeet/dp/161729134X)** by [Jon Skeet](http://www.amazon.com/Jon-Skeet/e/B001JP0M8K/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)

>C# in Depth is a book for those who are passionate about C#. It aims to be a bridge between the existing introductory books and the language specification: something readable but detailed, exploring every aspect of the language from version 2 onwards. In the interests of brevity, it doesn't spend much time on C# 1 - readers are already expected to know the first version at least reasonably. Every new feature from C# 2 onwards is covered, however, as shown in the table of contents below. - [C# in Depth](http://csharpindepth.com/)

> Refactoring is about improving the design of existing code. It is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, yet improves its internal structure. With refactoring you can even take a bad design and rework it into a good one. This book offers a thorough discussion of the principles of refactoring, including where to spot opportunities for refactoring, and how to set up the required tests. There is also a catalog of more than 40 proven refactorings with details as to when and why to use the refactoring, step by step instructions for implementing it, and an example illustrating how it works The book is written using Java as its principle language, but the ideas are applicable to any OO language. - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1429428810&sr=1-1&keywords=refactoring+martin+fowler)

### For those about to rock ###

Software is about solving people problems and to do that you need more than just coding skills. If you want to rock you need to deliver the software as people expect it. On top of the technical books I recommend a few books that can help you rock.

**[User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development](http://www.amazon.com/User-Stories-Applied-Software-Development/dp/0321205685)** by [Mike Cohn](http://www.amazon.com/Mike-Cohn/e/B001H6MN56/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)

> The best way to build software that meets users' needs is to begin with "user stories": simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality that will be valuable to real users. In User Stories Applied, Mike Cohn provides you with a front-to-back blueprint for writing these user stories and weaving them into your development lifecycle. - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/User-Stories-Applied-Software-Development/dp/0321205685)

**[Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects](http://www.amazon.com/Impact-Mapping-software-products-projects-ebook/dp/B009KWDKVA)** by [Gojko Adzic](http://www.amazon.com/Gojko-Adzic/e/B004P9W8G6/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1)

> This handbook is a practical guide to impact mapping, a simple yet incredibly effective method for collaborative strategic planning that helps organisations make an impact with software. Impact mapping helps to create better plans and roadmaps that ensure alignment of business and delivery, and are easily adaptable to change. Impact mapping fits nicely into several current trends in software product management and release planning, including goal-oriented requirements engineering, frequent iterative delivery, agile and lean software methods, lean startup product development cycles, and design thinking. - [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Impact-Mapping-software-products-projects-ebook/dp/B009KWDKVA)


**[Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories](https://leanpub.com/50quickideas)** by [Gojko Adzic](https://leanpub.com/u/gojko), [David Evans](https://leanpub.com/u/davidevans_neuri)

> This is a book for anyone working in an iterative delivery environment, doing planning with user stories. The ideas in this book are useful both to people relatively new to user stories and those who have been working with them for years. People who work in software delivery, regardless of their role, will find plenty of tips for engaging stakeholders better and structuring iterative plans more effectively. Business stakeholders working with software teams will discover how to provide better information to their delivery groups, how to set better priorities and how to outrun the competition by achieving more with less software. - [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/50quickideas)
