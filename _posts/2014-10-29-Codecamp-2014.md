summary: ">One of my personal objectives for this year was to attend as a speaker to local community developer conferences. Most known,at least by me, are ITCamp and Codecamp. ITCamp is held once a year in Cluj-Napoca and Codecamp is held twice a year in Iasi, although there are some smaller Codecamp events in Cluj those are not related. I'm really happy that this year I had the opportunity to participate at all 3 events, so a big big thanks to the organizers for having me."

### Codecamp ###

I've never been to Iasi until this year and I can't say that I've seen too much of it since both times I've been there I was caught up with [Codecamp](http://iasi.codecamp.ro/) event. Although I've haven't seen much of the city I've met really nice people which are really passionate about software industry. Each event had more than 1400 participants which I believe it's a really big achievement. The fact that there is no fee to participate at the conference opened the door even to students which had a great opportunity to get in touch with the industry and basically their future. The event is also for seniors who can find lots interesting topics and a good place to network.

For me [Codecamp](http://iasi.codecamp.ro/) was a nice experience and I can't wait for the next edition which will probably happen in spring 2015. Kudos to [Florin Cardasim](https://ro.linkedin.com/in/cardasim), [Gabriel Enea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielenea) and [Dan Nicola](http://ro.linkedin.com/in/dannicola) who believed in their ideas and made this possible.


### My sessions ###

I had two session which I presented this year at [Codecamp](http://iasi.codecamp.ro/). The first one which I've done in may is **Information Exchange using Hybrid Azure Integration**. In this session I'm talking about ways we can integrate on-premise LOB applications with azure cloud solutions based on messaging pattern. The second session which I had last weekend is **Click'n'Deploy**. This one was done together with [Radu Pascal](http://www.radupascal.com/) and it was my first duet session. In this talk we present our approach on enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment using [TFS Build](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/get-started/build-your-apps-vs.aspx), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Octopus Deploy](https://octopusdeploy.com/). During the session we showed how we've implemented it in a real life example.
