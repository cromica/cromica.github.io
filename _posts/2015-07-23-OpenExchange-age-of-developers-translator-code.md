This article is meant to be a short guide for translators that are willing to augment their productivity and ease their day to day work by writing plugins for Sdl Studio, but they don't know from where to start.</p>

### Age of developers - table of contents###

As I release parts of this series I will update this page with links to the articles.

1. [Introduction](http://romuluscrisan.com/sdl%20studio/2015/07/20/OpenExchange-age-of-developers.html)

### I'm a translator do I need to write code?###

The short answer is yes. In order to make an Sdl Studio plugin and publish it on OpenExchange you need to write code. Sdl Studio is developed using Microsoft technology called [Microsoft .Net](http://www.microsoft.com/net). The platform allows you to build all kind of apps from desktop (like Studio) to web and mobile. [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/), principal program manager and community architect at Microsoft, estimates that there are [~8 million](http://www.quora.com/How-many-NET-developers-are-there) .net developers out there. [Microsoft .Net](http://www.microsoft.com/net) platform has support for [many programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages) but the most popular is C# (CSharp). I also recommend learning this language since you will be able to find many resources to help you in your learning journey.

### Why should I bother?###

This is a though one to answer since every person is different and there is no silver bullet answer. Something that resonates for someone might not resonate for someone else. So here's my list that might help you answer this question:

- Are you waiting for a feature to be added in the software? Take the issue in your own hands and fix it. You will fill accomplished after you've done it, you will gain recognition in the industry and why not you can earn some extra money.
- [Everyone Should Learn To Program, But Not Everyone Should Be A Programmer](http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/03/31/everyone-should-learn-to-program-but-not-everyone-should-be-a-programmer/) What if only writers could write and if you need to write an email to your boss you need to ask the company writer do it? I agree that programming and writing are not the same thing but what I'm trying to say is that learning to program doesn't necessarily mean you became a professional developer. There's much more that writing code in being a professional developer.
- Nowadays learning to write code is much easier than 5, 10 or 20 years ago. You have much better tooling and the languages are much more abstract, meaning you don't need to know all the details of how the computer works in order to write a line of code.
- There is a strong movement for every kid to learn how to program. This doesn't mean everyone should become a developer but it's the best way to promote [Computational thinking](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/link/research-notebook-computational-thinking-what-and-why). Computational thinking teaches you how to tackle large problems by breaking down into smaller, more manageable problems.

Hope this will help you understand why should you bother learn to program (write code).

### From where do I start?###

First thing you need to start writing apps for OpenExchange is Microsoft Visual Studio. This is the tool of choice to write code for [Microsoft .Net](http://www.microsoft.com/net) platform. The good news is that you can get a free version with all the features you need. This version is called Visual Studio Community Edition and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx). You can opt for 2015 or 2013 version and you should choose the one you prefer.

 Next step would be to start learning some basics of programming in C#. There are books you can read but personally I like watching videos, so here's some courses you should look into:

1. [C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-8295) This will walk you through all the constructions you need to build basic applications using C#. At the time this video was recorded Visual Studio Community Edition was not released so this is not mentioned but I recommend you to use it instead of Visual Studio Express Edition.
2. [Software Development Fundamentals](https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-US/training-courses/software-development-fundamentals-8248) This is a very detailed presentation on software development in general not necessarily only with C#. Some of the parts might be a bit advanced and not needed since the main objective hear is to learn some basic programming rather than becoming a programmer.
3. [C# Fundamentals with C# 5.0](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-fundamentals-csharp5) This is a great video which I highly recommend but except the previous 2 for this service you have to pay but you get over 4000 courses of great quality.

Although watching those videos provides lots of information the only way you can actually learn is by practice so I highly suggest to stop the video practice what you've seen. 

If you prefer to learn from books I highly recommend [C# in depth](http://csharpindepth.com/) but I still suggest to accompany the book with some of the above videos.

One last thing, you're not alone in this so don't hesitate to ask for help. As I've said earlier in the article, there's a really big .net community. My suggestions would be to ask question on the [Sdl language developers](https://community.sdl.com/developers/language-developers/) community website. Don't hesitate to ask general programming questions in there even though there are not directly related to any of SDL products.There is the [Getting Started](https://community.sdl.com/developers/language-developers/f/61) area which is just the right place for this type of discussions.


### Conclusion###

My best advice is to have patience, practice as much as possible and don't be afraid to ask. I'm sure the results will come sooner or later. Happy coding.
