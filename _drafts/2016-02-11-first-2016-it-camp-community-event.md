<p class="dropcap">We are already mid february 2016 and the it events in Cluj are pilling up big time. This is going to be a really busy spring and of course really intersting. To name, chronologicaly, just a few of which I'm aware <a href="http://hellojs.org/" target="_blank">Hellojs</a>, <a href="http://cluj.codecamp.ro/" target="_blank">Codecamp</a>, <a href="http://devtalks.ro/" target="_blank">Devtalks</a>, <a href="http://www.romaniatesting.ro/" target="_blank">Romanian Testing Conference</a>, <a href="http://www.techsylvania.co/" target="_blank">Techsylvania</a> and <a href="http://itcamp.ro/" target="_blank">ITCamp</a>. I won't be too surprised if I missed one or two ... . Suprisingly most of them are in may so till then I suggest to warm-up a bit with the first 2016 edtion of <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/itcamp-community-event-tickets-21433906391" target="_blank">ITCamp community event</a> which will happen on the 24th of february.

### Why should I come?

Well there are plenty of reasons to come, like meeting fellow developers from other companies (some of you might not be attracted by this but trust me it's nice to learn about what others are doing), having a coffee (or beer shhhtt...) and maybe, just maybe, if you are not too tired by that time hear what the speakers have to say.

### Who's speaking?

There are two session schedule for this event. One of the session is going to be presented by Radu Vunvulea, checkout his [Tech Wall](http://vunvulearadu.blogspot.ro/) for more details, and the second is going to be presented by me. I guess if you end up reading this article you probably know me but if you somehow find this by mistake just click around and you might get some info about me.
