<p class="dropcap">We are already mid february 2016 and the it events in Cluj are pilling up big time. This is going to be a really busy spring and of course really intersting. To name, chronologicaly, just a few of which I'm aware <a href="http://hellojs.org/" target="_blank">Hellojs</a>, <a href="http://cluj.codecamp.ro/" target="_blank">Codecamp</a>, <a href="http://devtalks.ro/" target="_blank">Devtalks</a>, <a href="http://www.romaniatesting.ro//" target="_blank">Romanian Testing Conference</a>, <a href="http://www.techsylvania.co//" target="_blank">Techsylvania</a> and <a href="http://itcamp.ro/" target="_blank">ITCamp</a>. I won't be too surprised if I missed one or two ... . Suprisingly most of them are in may so till then I suggest to warm-up a bit with the first 2016 edtion of <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/itcamp-community-event-tickets-21433906391" target="_blank">ITCamp community event</a> which will happen on the 24th of february.</p>
