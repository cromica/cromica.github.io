<p class="dropcap">Latest SDL Studio update, cumulative update 10, was released on 13th of May and together with this update there a few additions to the integration API. If you want to see the entire list of changes included in this update have a look <a href="http://kb.sdl.com/#tab:homeTab:crumb:7:artId:5375" target="_blank">here</a>. Now lets get down to business and talk about the integration api changes.</p>

<h3 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h3>

<p>This is a pretty long post and you might not want to read through the entire article so if you want to read only a specific topic I prepared a jump-list with the topics I cover in this article:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#segment-translation-on-demand">Segment translation on-demand</a></li>
  <li><a href="#active-file-properties">Active file properties</a></li>
  <li><a href="#accessupdate-segment-and-paragraph-unit-properties">Access/update segment and paragraph unit properties</a></li>
  <li><a href="#crud-operations-on-comments">CRUD operations on comments</a></li>
  <li><a href="#change-segment-confirmation-level">Change segment confirmation level</a></li>
  <li><a href="#autosuggest-provider-icon">AutoSuggest provider icon</a></li>
  <li><a href="#segment-content-ready">Segment Content ready</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="segment-translation-on-demand">Segment translation on-demand</h3>

<p>Segment translation is done by the translation providers that are configured and enabled at the project level. This can happen as a pre-translation step or when the current segment is changed by the user in the user interface. With this new feature added to the integration API a developer is able to request the translation of the current selected segment whenever this is needed. This can be done from the <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/StudioIntegrationApi/3.0/html/2a868ca0-831d-4614-9763-2bf928a0f3fb.htm">EditorController</a>. To see this in action you can look at this sample:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/4676c94c596aa174c4f4.js"></script>

<p>This sample code is take from the <a href="https://github.com/sdl/Sdl-Community/tree/master/Controlled%20Machine%20Translation%20Providers">Controlled Machine Translation Providers</a> plugin.</p>

<h3 id="active-file-properties">Active file properties</h3>

<p>Until now developers were only able to get information about <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/ProjectAutomationApi/3.0/html/2b0cadd0-8be7-eea2-f974-bb14bdcb6db8.htm">ActiveFile</a> like statistics, language, project id and so on. There was no way to get information like creation date, change date, metada and so on. This is now possible using <em>ActiveFileProperties</em> property of the <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/StudioIntegrationApi/3.0/html/9bb61319-d033-7198-9aee-b29eb5f759e9.htm">Document</a> class. Also an event was added to notify when the active file properties are changed.</p>

<h3 id="accessupdate-segment-and-paragraph-unit-properties">Access/update segment and paragraph unit properties</h3>

<p>If you needed to make any work around segments the only available option was to use <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/StudioIntegrationApi/3.0/html/b4f43e30-8ba6-f2c2-7ea2-883ab83d1d67.htm">ProcessSegmentPairs</a> method from the <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/StudioIntegrationApi/3.0/html/9bb61319-d033-7198-9aee-b29eb5f759e9.htm">Document</a> class. Now this can do the trick but it’s not straightforward to use and can be an overhead for simple scenarios, also this method was not providing any way to interact with paragraph units. We’ve now added a couple other options that provide more granularity and flexibility in how a developer is able to process segments. We also added  capabilities to work directly with paragraph units. Here’s the list with the methods available:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>GetSegmentPairsFromParagraph</em> - Based on the paragraph id you can obtain the segment pairs of that paragraph</li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/92f94e278fe1c41d6a46.js"></script>

<ol>
  <li><em>UpdateSegmentPair</em> - updates the document with the specified segment pair</li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/4182815a61117b5a3dbb.js"></script>

<ol>
  <li><em>UpdateSegmentPairProperties</em> - updates the document with the specified segment pair properties</li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/233216998995c82eaaef.js"></script>

<ol>
  <li><em>UpdateParagraphProperties</em> - updates the document with the specified paragraph properties</li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/c755798e710a09b153aa.js"></script>

<h3 id="crud-operations-on-comments">CRUD operations on comments</h3>

<p>Adding comments was only possible using <a href="https://community.sdl.com/developers/language-developers/f/57/p/3414/12658#12658">Billingual API</a>. While this is fine when you want to do it for your custom file type is not productive to use it when you just want to add comments to your well known file type. To solve this issue the integration api has now specialized methods that allow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> operations for comments. Here’s the list with the methods available: </p>

<ol>
  <li><em>AddCommentOnSegment</em></li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/86234330eb378a3798de.js"></script>

<ol>
  <li><em>UpdateCommentOnSegment</em></li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/5b1931864dcbe16935e1.js"></script>

<ol>
  <li><em>DeleteCommentOnSegment</em></li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/a281d232959dbabe1222.js"></script>

<ol>
  <li><em>DeleteAllCommentsOnSegment</em></li>
</ol>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/363b895641c7443c1bdf.js"></script>

<h3 id="change-segment-confirmation-level">Change segment confirmation level</h3>

<p>Developers are now able to change the segment confirmation level using the integration API and also they can now subscribe to an event that is trigger when the confirmation level is changed.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/b70a13dd8c08f8882ecb.js"></script>

<h3 id="autosuggest-provider-icon">AutoSuggest provider icon</h3>

<p>Developer can now add custom icons for their AutoSuggest providers.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/a55d2a6b9cbd848af1b7.js"></script>

<h3 id="segment-content-ready">Segment Content ready</h3>

<p>There are situations where you may want to do some additional work after the translation has been done. To cover this type of situation the event <em>ActiveSegmentContentIsReady</em> was added to the <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/StudioIntegrationApi/3.0/html/9bb61319-d033-7198-9aee-b29eb5f759e9.htm">Document</a> class.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/playing-with-settings/playing-with-settings.png" alt="Playing with SDL Studio settings" title="Playing with SDL Studio settings" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p class="dropcap">SDL Studio is a complex and extendable application witch comes with a few APIs that allows any developer to extend the application in all kind of ways. To be more exact there are 6 APIs you can use to build your application. This degree of complexity and extensibility translates in a huge amount of settings you can play with. The user interface does a great job presenting them in a meaningful way but that is not the same when you want to develop something in your custom applications and you need to read or update some of the settings.</p>

<h3 id="project-settings">Project Settings</h3>

<p>Lets say you are in a situation where the API is not offering you direct access to the user setting you would like to change, what options you have in this situation? A great amount of settings are store in the project file which in essence it’s an xml file. This mean I could use the standard .NET libraries to parse the project xml file and change what I need. This is completely true and can be done but the problem is knowing the xml structure which for the project file can be pretty complex and hard to understand. To give you an example the project file for a very simple test project is over 1000 lines. Understanding those lines can take some time and patience. Before continuing I want to clarify one thing which is knowing that the SDL Studio project file is not only about user settings it’s much more than that, things that are used internal by Studio so we need to be very careful when we change anything in this file. My recommendation would be to use the <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/Core/3.0/search.html?SearchText=settingsbundle">settings classes</a> exposed by SDL Studio Core API.</p>

<h3 id="settings-bundle-and-group">Settings Bundle and Group</h3>

<p>User settings are stored in hierarchical structure as settings bundles. A bundle is bound to a feature from SDL Studio. For example I can have a settings bundle for project specific settings, another project bundle with settings for language direction, another one for language file and so on. Each bundle will have unique identifier as a GUID value and can have one or multiple child elements in form of settings group. A settings group represent a smaller piece from the bundle feature and can have, as child’s, one or multiple settings. As an example of settings group you can think at specific settings for a file type which is part of the project settings bundle.</p>

<p>With this said the SDL Studio API has <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/Core/3.0/html/9e4ba18c-dab1-bb47-0ce7-a31fb3002ba3.htm">ISettingsBundle</a> interface and a <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/Core/3.0/html/72c76110-8d6c-6315-58d9-dc36b998d14b.htm">SettingsGroup</a> class used to represent the hierarchical structure I explained above. The API doesn’t expose a concrete implementation of <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/Core/3.0/html/9e4ba18c-dab1-bb47-0ce7-a31fb3002ba3.htm">ISettingsBundle</a> so you need to use <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/Core/3.0/html/ae69c32c-3ebe-946f-3e3c-d091278a407f.htm">SettingsUtils</a> class to create an instance of settings bundle.</p>

<h3 id="real-use-case">Real use case</h3>

<p>To clarify the things a bit I want to show you a real use case where you can use the settings classes from the SDL Studio Core API. Let’s say that for a project we want to disable all the global verifiers. This value is kept in the project file and can be changed using .NET xml libraries or using the settings classes I explained in the previous paragraph. Here’s the code required to implement this feature:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/7299796351f364d93aa5.js"></script>

<p>In this case I obtain the settings group id by instantiating all the global verifiers but you can request the setting group also by just providing the string. </p>

<p>Please leave a comment if you have any questions.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/studio-plugin-versioning/version.jpg" alt="Studio plugin versioning" title="Studio plugin versioning" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p class="dropcap">SDL Studio 2015 is just around the corner and as a plugin developer there are a few things you should do to make your plugin compatible with this new Studio version. You can read more about this here: <a href="https://community.sdl.com/developers/language-developers/w/wiki/647.steps-to-upgrade-your-plugin-for-studio-2015">Steps to upgrade your plugin for Studio 2015</a>. Now with all Studio versions out there some may ask how can I control my plugin versions and how can I make sure my plugin will be used only by the appropriate version of SDL Studio.</p>

<h3 id="plugin-manifest">Plugin manifest</h3>

<p>Every plugin must contain a manifest file that defines a few general information about your plugin. The file is called <em>pluginpackage.manifest.xml</em> and if you open any *.sdlplugin file with and archiving tool, like <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a>, you should be able to see it and open it. Also when you create a new plugin solution in Microsoft Visual Studio this file will be automatically created for you and it will be included in our plugin package (.sdlplugin file). In this file you can add your plugin name, description, author, version, required product and you can <a href="http://romuluscrisan.com/sdl%20studio/2014/11/07/3rd-party-assmeblies-and-SDL-Studio-plugins.html">specify additional files to be included in the package</a>.</p>

<h3 id="plugin-versioning">Plugin versioning</h3>

<p>As I highlighted before you can specify a plugin version by using the tag:
&gt; Version</p>

<p>This is used by SDL Studio to remove previously deployed plugins. For example if you have on your machine a plugin with version 0.1.0.0 if you install a new version like 0.1.1.0 it will automatically remove the unpacked version of the plugin and unpack the newer version. If the version is the same or lower this will not happen hence you will have to do it yourself.</p>

<h3 id="product-versioning">Product versioning</h3>

<p>Besides plugin versioning you can also specify SDL Studio versions that are compatible with your plugin. This can be done using the tag:
&gt;RequiredProduct</p>

<p>On this tag you can specify in the attribute <em>minversion</em> the lowest SDL Studio version that is compatible with your plugin. For example if you specify a minimum version of <em>10.0</em> this means that your plugin will be compatible with Studio 2011 or higher. If you want to limit your plugin just to a specific SDL Studio version you can also specify a <em>maxversion</em> attribute. So for example if in our case we add a maximum version of <em>10.9</em> this will not be compatible with Studio 2014 or higher and even if it’s copied into the Studio 2014 plugins folder it will be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="universal-plugin-installer">Universal plugin installer</h3>

<p>The universal plugin installer is also using this information to avoid deploying plugins that are not compatible with a specific Studio version. If you are not familiar with the universal plugin installer you can read more here: <a href="https://github.com/sdl/Sdl-plugin-installer">SDL plugin installer</a>.</p>

<h3 id="final-words">Final words</h3>

<p>I recommend to review your manifest file and take advantage of the versioning capabilities. Even if there is no obvious reason at the moment it might prove handy in the future. </p>

<p>Please leave a comment if you have any questions.</p>

<p>This are some of the books I recommend for developers which are just starting their career. It’s not that they shouldn’t read more advanced books but those might be a bit too difficult for the moment.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</a></strong> by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1">Robert C. Martin</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The book is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Amazon</a> </p>

  <p>In The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act. - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073">Amazon</a></p>

  <p>C# in Depth is a book for those who are passionate about C#. It aims to be a bridge between the existing introductory books and the language specification: something readable but detailed, exploring every aspect of the language from version 2 onwards. In the interests of brevity, it doesn’t spend much time on C# 1 - readers are already expected to know the first version at least reasonably. Every new feature from C# 2 onwards is covered, however, as shown in the table of contents below. - <a href="http://csharpindepth.com/">C# in Depth</a></p>

  <p>Refactoring is about improving the design of existing code. It is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, yet improves its internal structure. With refactoring you can even take a bad design and rework it into a good one. This book offers a thorough discussion of the principles of refactoring, including where to spot opportunities for refactoring, and how to set up the required tests. There is also a catalog of more than 40 proven refactorings with details as to when and why to use the refactoring, step by step instructions for implementing it, and an example illustrating how it works The book is written using Java as its principle language, but the ideas are applicable to any OO language. - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429428810&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=refactoring+martin+fowler">Amazon</a></p>

<h3 id="for-those-about-to-rock">For those about to rock</h3>

<p>Software is about solving people problems and to do that you need more than just coding skills. If you want to rock you need to deliver the software as people expect it. On top of the technical books I recommend a few books that can help you rock.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best way to build software that meets users’ needs is to begin with “user stories”: simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality that will be valuable to real users. In User Stories Applied, Mike Cohn provides you with a front-to-back blueprint for writing these user stories and weaving them into your development lifecycle. - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/User-Stories-Applied-Software-Development/dp/0321205685">Amazon</a></p>

<p class="dropcap">SDL Studio allows the user to merge multiple files into one bilingual document (sdlxliff). This can be done during project creation and it can be useful in situations where you have multiple small files and you might want to translate them in one go without switching between documents. If you don't already know SDL Studio is very extensible via the API's that are made available but sometimes simple things are not so simple to do by code because of software design decision or technical limitations. Merging files using SDL Studio Project Automation API can be done but is not that straight forward as you might expect and this is why I decided to write this article to show how this is done.</p>

<h3 id="create-merged-project-file">Create Merged Project File</h3>

<p>Looking at the documentation you can easily find <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/ProjectAutomationApi/3.0/html/8c0d6583-c31c-365b-0819-ff19e18e1f5e.htm">CreateMergedProjectFile</a> method which allows you to specify the files you want to be merged and the name of the bilingual file which must have “.sdlxliff” extension. At this point this seems to be very simple but when you run this method you realize that is not actually doing much, there is no visible result on the project and the status is <em>Not Merged</em>. </p>

<h3 id="what-am-i-missing">What am I missing?</h3>

<p>At this point you only get an <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/ProjectAutomationApi/3.0/html/4ea34241-0524-aac3-45fa-817765b3bc5e.htm">MergedProjectFile</a> object which is just a representation of the merging structure. In order to actually create the bilingual merged file we need to use <a href="http://producthelp.sdl.com/SDK/FileTypeSupport/3.0/html/1f5584af-9763-46ff-894b-08127a2421a7.htm">Studio File Type Framework</a> to generate the sdlxliff file. Once we have that we can use <em>CopyToTargetLanguages</em> to copy the merged files to all target languages we need. To make this even more clear and concrete I’m going to share a sample code that is doing all the steps I’ve described until now.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/cromica/af1242f60511c52fba79.js"></script>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>It’s not that complicated to merge files using the SDL Studio API but is not obvious and intuitive. I hope this article will clarify this situation. </p>

<p>Please leave a comment if you have any questions or feedback.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Starting from today Sdl Studio powerhsell toolkit is open source and you can find it on github. The toolkit was written to facilitate scripting of the Project Automation API which comes with SDL Studio. Until now this was kept on the SDL internal TFS and you where only able to get it by going to the community forum. At this point you might ask yourself what's going to change from now on since the toolkit was freely distributed until now?</p>

<h3 id="github">Github</h3>

<p>The project is now hosted on github in this <a href="https://github.com/sdl/Sdl-studio-powershell-toolkit">location</a>. The internal TFS will no longer be used so this means that every change that will be made to the toolkit will be made on this repository including changes done by Sdl developers. Also this allows any interested developer to contribute to the toolkit. </p>

<p>Public releases are also hosted on github and you can be find them <a href="https://github.com/sdl/Sdl-studio-powershell-toolkit/releases/">here</a>. You are now able to download the entire toolkit or just one of the modules. </p>

<h3 id="open-source">Open source</h3>

<p>Open source it’s not at all equal to free, it’s much more than that. Yes you don’t have to pay any money for this toolkit but from now on is not only Sdl’s responsibility to maintain this toolkit, it’s also the responsibility of each toolkit user or developer. To be a bit more specific if you find bug or want a new feature you can log it <a href="https://github.com/sdl/Sdl-studio-powershell-toolkit/issues">here</a> but don’t necessarily expect someone from Sdl to resolve the issue, it might be anyone from the community or even you.</p>

<p>Another important aspect that comes with open source is that every change you made to this toolkit has to be made open source. It’s not mandatory to be made in the same repository but it has to be open source. I would encourage everyone to contribute to this repository and make the resolved issues available to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Contribute to Sdl Studio PowerShell toolkit from <a href="https://github.com/sdl/Sdl-studio-powershell-toolkit">here</a> or download the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/sdl/Sdl-studio-powershell-toolkit/releases/tag/1.0.0.0">here</a>. </p>

<p class="dropcap">App stores changed the way we install and maintain software on our devices.

In a similar way you can extend SDL Studio by going on <a href="http://www.translationzone.com/openexchange/">OpenExchange</a> store and download a plugin you would like or need.

This article and video is about an alternate solution for this type of scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The solution</h3>

<p>The solution is very simple and is based on the idea to automate as much as possible the process of releasing you plugin. The exact same thing is promoted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">Continuous Delivery</a>  practice and together with the evolution of this a couple of release management tools like <a href="https://octopusdeploy.com/">Octopus Deploy</a> or <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/go-continuous-delivery">GO</a> appeared in order to ease the adoption of such a practice. In our case since Studio plugins are developed using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net">Microsoft .Net</a> and it makes perfect sense to use <a href="https://octopusdeploy.com/">Octopus Deploy</a> since is dedicated for .Net solutions. Of course you can try and use <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/go-continuous-delivery">GO</a> or any other release management tool you prefer. If it’s not clear by now the solution I’m talking about is to automate your Studio plugin release management using <a href="https://octopusdeploy.com/">Octopus Deploy</a>.   </p>

<h3 id="octopus-deploy">Octopus Deploy</h3>

<p>I’m not going to cover in detail <a href="https://octopusdeploy.com/">Octopus Deploy</a> since it comes with a very good documentation, rather I’m going to present a higher level overview of how is going to work with Studio plugins. Octopus comes with a central server component which is called <a href="http://docs.octopusdeploy.com/display/OD/Installing+Octopus">Octopus Deploy Server</a> that you need to install somewhere where all your users machines will be able to access it. It can be an internal private server, a public server or somewhere in a cloud platform, there is no limitation as long as it’s accessible. <a href="http://docs.octopusdeploy.com/display/OD/Installing+Octopus">Octopus Deploy Server</a> comes with web user interface which you can use once you have the server installed. Besides the server component Octopus comes with a client component called <a href="http://docs.octopusdeploy.com/display/OD/Installing+Tentacles">Tentacle Deploy agent</a>. This has to be installed on each user machine and it will be used to deploy your software, in our case the Studio plugins. This is a one time operation and once it’s done you will only use the web user interface that comes with the server. There is a third component called <a href="http://docs.octopusdeploy.com/display/OD/Using+OctoPack">OctoPack</a> that is used to push the software/Studio plugin from you development or build machine to <a href="http://docs.octopusdeploy.com/display/OD/Installing+Octopus">Octopus Deploy Server</a>.  </p>

<h3 id="clickndeploy-studio-plugins">Click’n’Deploy Studio plugins</h3>

<p>There are quit a few moving parts when you first setup <a href="https://octopusdeploy.com/">Octopus Deploy</a> and some of the steps might not that obvious so instead off writing them in this article I decided that it would be better if just create a video to show you exactly how you configure Octopus to release Studio plugins to the user machine. </p>

The documentation is providing an overview of the entire framework and also includes high level overview of what I'm going to discuss in this article. </p>

<h3 id="visitor-pattern">Visitor Pattern</h3>

<p>Before jumping into the problem I recommend you to get familiarized with the visitor pattern since this is used as part of the Studio File Type Framework and you will need apply it in order to get the tags. To get familiarized you can read the theory on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">wikipedia</a> or if you want a practical example you can have a look <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/588882/TheplusVisitorplusPatternplusExplained">here</a>.</p>

<p>In Studio File Type Framework visitor pattern is made available via <em>IMarkupDataVisitor</em> interface. </p>

<h3 id="paragraphs-segments-and-more">Paragraphs, Segments and more</h3>

<p>When a document is opened for translation Studio brakes it into segments. This is done by the segmentation engine using the segmentation rules defined in Studio. A segment can be a paragraph or a sentence length but what is important to understand is that for Studio a segment represents a piece of localizable content for which existing translations can possibly be used. Besides localizable content there are other elements, like formatting, that Studio needs to take into considerations.</p>

<p>Now that we have a better understanding of how Studio is handling the content let me highlight how this is reflected in the File Type Framework:</p>

<p><code>IParagraph</code> represents the entire content that is displayed on one Studio editor row. This can contain multiple elements like tags or segments.</p>

<p><code>IParagraphUnit</code> a unit of source language content and the localized target language content. Source and Target can be accessed using the corresponding properties which will return an <em>IParagraph</em> object instance with the information described above. One thing to keep in mind is that there are two type of paragraph units:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Structure paragraph units will contain only structure tags that are not localizable. In this case the Target will be null.</li>
  <li>Localizable paragraph units will contain localizable content.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>ISegment</code> represents a piece of localizable content.</p>

<p><code>ISegmentPair</code> segments exists in source and target language versions which are bot accessible using <em>ISegmentPair</em>. </p>

<p>Segments and Paragraphs are considered containers of other elements like text, comments, revisions and so on. All containers share common behavior and that’s why in the File Type Framework both are abstracted using <em>IAbstractMarkupDataContainer</em>. An <em>IAbstractMarkupDataContainer</em> contains multiple <em>IAbstractMarkupData</em> elements. This means that text, comments and other similar elements are represented in the framework using <em>IAbstractMarkupData</em> interface. One very important aspect of this structure is the fact that a segment can be considered as an element of the paragraph but also as a container for other elements which means that it can be manipulated as an <em>IAbstractMarkupDataContainer</em> or as an <em>IAbstractMarkupData</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram which describes the structure:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/segmentTags/abstractmarkupdatacontainer.png" alt="Abstract Markup Data Container" title="Abstract Markup Data Container" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h3 id="access-segment-tags">Access segment tags</h3>

<p>All paragraph elements are like a tree structure that must be traversed using visitor pattern. For each paragraph unit we can look at the Source property which is an <em>IParagraph</em>. Thinking at the abstraction I was talking earlier an <em>IParagraph</em> is in essence an <em>IAbstractMarkupDataContainer</em> which in turn is an enumeration of <em>IAbstractMarkupData</em>. Here’s a sample code on how you can iterate paragraph unit elements:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="n">IEnumerable</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">IAbstractMarkupData</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">container</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">paragraphUnit</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Source</span><span class="p">;</span>
 
<span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">contentItem</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">container</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">//structure tag is not supported by IMarkupDataVisitor and you should ignore it</span>
    <span class="n">IStructureTag</span> <span class="n">stag</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">contentItem</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">IStructureTag</span><span class="p">;</span>
       <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stag</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">continue</span><span class="p">;</span>
                       
      <span class="n">contentItem</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AcceptVisitor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">MarkupDataVisitor</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>There is one new thing in the above sample which I didn’t discuss about.This is <em>MarkupDataVisitor</em> which is an implementation of the interface <em>IMarkupDataVisitor</em> I was mentioning in the visitor pattern section. Here’s how the interface looks like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="c1">/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
<span class="c1">/// Interface for the visitor in the visitor pattern implementation for translatable source / target </span>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see you are now able manipulate each element type. For example if you need formatting information you can get it from the <em>ITagPair</em> interface. </p>

<p><strong>Don’t forget</strong> that segments are containers as well so on <em>VisitSegement</em> method you need to traverse his structure in the same way as for the paragraph unit.</p>

<p class="dropcap">SDL Studio plugin system allows developers to develop new features on top of the standard functionality. There are 2 types of plugins that can be developed, one which behaves like a Studio add-in and another one which behaves as a standalone application. Both plugin types require to run inside Studio installation folder. This is because the public Studio SDK is using other assemblies that are located in Studio folder. While this is perfectly fine for add-in type plugins for standalone plugins this adds limitation on where and how you can deploy your application.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-gac-">Why not GAC ?</h3>

<p>Many developers have asked us to register Studio assemblies in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yf1d93sz%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">GAC</a> in order to solve the issue on where and how you can deploy your standalone Studio plugins. Having Studio assemblies registered in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yf1d93sz%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">GAC</a> means that those assembly can be shared across the entire system. Although registering assemblies in GAC might had seem to be a good solution there are many implications when doing it. The main reason why Studio is not using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yf1d93sz%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">GAC</a> is because of the following scenario:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>GAC supports multiple version of an assembly. This means that when an assembly is updated to a newer version both versions will be saved. You might say that the old version should be removed, but this is not always possible since for example there are customers that have multiple version of Studio that are used on the same machine. Keeping multiple version of the same assembly will lead to unexpected behavior and errors from the application.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can read more about why to avoid GAC <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/Posts/Details/12503">here</a>.   </p>

<h3 id="got-it--no-gac-but-we-want-solutions">Got it … no GAC, but we want solutions!</h3>

<p>To solve this problem I’ve developed a small library called <strong>Studio AssemblyResolver</strong>. Basically every time an dll is not found in the current application location the library will look after the dll in the Studio folder. The library comes with 2 mechanism for looking after Studio folder but you can add your own resolve mechanism. If you are interested about more details please have a look <a href="https://github.com/cromica/Studio-AssemblyResolver">here</a>. The library is also published in the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Studio.AssemblyResolver/0.1.1">Nuget package repository</a> which allows to be easily added to your project.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-studio-assemblyresolver">How to use Studio AssemblyResolver</h3>

<p>There are 2 simple steps to get your Studio assemblies resolved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a reference to the <strong>Studio.AssemblyResolver</strong> library from Visual Studio using NuGet</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/assemblyresolver/managenuget.png" alt="Manage Nuget" title="Manage Nuget" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/assemblyresolver/nugetassemblyresolver.png" alt="Nuget assembly resolver" title="Nuget assembly resolver" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Add the following line of code in you application entry point</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="n">AssemblyResolver</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Resolve</span><span class="p">();</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I’ve already included the <strong>Studio AssemblyResolver</strong> library in <a href="https://github.com/sdl/SDL-Community/tree/master/Reindex%20Translation%20Memories">Reindex Translation Memories</a> plugin. You can have a look <a href="https://github.com/sdl/SDL-Community/blob/master/Reindex%20Translation%20Memories/Sdl.Community.ReindexTms/Program.cs#L18">here</a> if you are interested to see how I’ve included the library.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Last week I was working at a new plugin for SDL Studio 2014 and I wanted to serialize some information in json. The best tool handle this type of operations in .NET, at least in my opinion, is <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/json" target="_blank">Json.NET</a>. It made perfect sense to use it but until now I didn't use any external dependencies in an SDL Studio plugin so I started to look into what options we have to deploy our plugins together with 3rd party assemblies.</p>

<h3 id="sdl-studio-plugins">SDL Studio plugins</h3>

<p>This is not a detailed look at what SDL Studio plugins are but I want to give a bit of context on how they are working. First of all each plugin has to be packed in a package with extension <code>.sldplugin</code> (this a zip file in essence). If you use the SDL Studio templates from Visual Studio this done for you automatically. Once you have the package you need to deploy it in one of the three location where SDL Studio is expecting plugins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>$(CurrentUser)\AppData\Local\SDL\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\Plugins\Packages\</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>$(CurrentUser)\AppData\Roaming\SDL\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\Plugins\Packages\</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>$(ProgramData)\SDL\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\Plugins\Packages\</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no difference between this locations so you can choose whatever you prefer. Once the package is in one of this locations when SDL Studio starts it will unpack the package, drop the content into a dedicated location and load the plugin assembly. This depends on where you deployed your package and can be one of this locations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>$(CurrentUser)\AppData\Local\SDL\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\Plugins\Unpacked\</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>$(CurrentUser)\AppData\Roaming\SDL\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\Plugins\Unpacked\</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>$(ProgramData)\SDL\SDL Trados Studio{Studio Version}\Plugins\Unpacked\</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="deploy-3rd-party-assemblies">Deploy 3rd party assemblies</h3>

<p>Now that we have a brief understanding on how SDL Studio handles plugins let’s see what options we have to deploy 3rd party plugins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Include the assemblies in the plugin package</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Create an installer which will copy the 3rd party assemblies into SDL Studio folder under $(ProgramFiles)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the second option can work I don’t like it because it requires more work, administrative rights to deploy the assemblies and might intefere with Studio installation. This was also suggest by <a href="https://community.sdl.com/members/davidfritch/default.aspx">David Fritch</a> in this <a href="https://community.sdl.com/phase_2_groups/sdl_openexchange_developers/f/39/t/3149.aspx">thread</a> as a possible way to do it.</p>

<p>I consider the first option the right way to do it since it’s very simple and clean. All you have to do is change the <code>pluginpackage.manifest.xml</code> which has to be part of the solution in order to generate the <code>.sdlplugin</code> file. By default this xml file contains some tags to specify the plugin name, version, description, author and required SDL Studio product. You will need to add an <code>&lt;Include&gt;</code> tag which in my case, for <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/json">Json.NET</a>, looked something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;Include&gt;</span>
	<span class="nt">&lt;File&gt;</span>Newtonsoft.Json.dll<span class="nt">&lt;/File&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/Include&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>You can have a look at my entire xml file <a href="https://github.com/sdl/SDL-Community/blob/master/Controlled%20Machine%20Translation%20Providers/Sdl.Community.ControlledMTProviders/pluginpackage.manifest.xml#L9">here</a>.</p>
